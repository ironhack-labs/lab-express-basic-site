                    Ned Ludd, possibly born Edward Ludlam, is the person from
                    whom, it is popularly claimed, the Luddites took their name.
                    In 1779, Ludd is supposed to have broken two stocking frames
                    in a fit of rage. When the "Luddites" emerged in the 1810s,
                    his identity was appropriated to become the folkloric
                    character of Captain Ludd, also known as King Ludd or
                    General Ludd, the Luddites' alleged leader and founder.

                <p>
                    Supposedly, Ludd was a weaver from Anstey, near Leicester,
                    England. In 1779, either after being whipped for idleness or
                    after being taunted by local youths, he smashed two knitting
                    frames in what was described as a "fit of passion". This
                    story is traceable to an article in The Nottingham Review on
                    20 December 1811, but there is no independent evidence of
                    its truth. John Blackner's book History of Nottingham, also
                    published in 1811, provides a variant tale, of a lad called
                    "Ludlam" who was told by his father, a framework-knitter, to
                    "square his needles". Ludlam took a hammer and "beat them
                    into a heap". News of the incident spread, and whenever
                    frames were sabotaged, people would jokingly say "Ned Ludd
                    did it". By 1812, organised frame-breakers became known as
                    Luddites, using the name King Ludd or Captain Ludd for their
                    mythical leader. Letters and proclamations were signed by
                    "Ned Ludd".
