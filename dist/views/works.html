                        Robert Calvert wrote and recorded another song "Ned
                        Ludd", which appeared on his 1985 album Freq; which
                        includes the lyrics:
                        <blockquote>
                            They said Ned Ludd was an idiot boy That all he
                            could do was wreck and destroy, and He turned to his
                            workmates and said: Death to Machines They tread on
                            our future and they stamp on our dreams.
                        </blockquote>
