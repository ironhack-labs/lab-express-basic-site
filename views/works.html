    </h3>

      In December 2016, Zendaya appeared as a guest judge in the season finale
      of the 15th season of the reality television series Project Runway.[50]
      She made her feature film debut as Michelle in the superhero film
      Spider-Man: Homecoming, which was released in July 2017.[51] Zendaya wore
      no makeup to her screen test, a decision that was carried through in
      production, and "add[ed] her own embellishments to the role, such as
      carrying around a mug of herbal tea."[52] The film grossed $117 million in
      its first weekend, ranking number one at the box office.[53] John DeFore
      of The Hollywood Reporter praised her as a "scene stealer,"[54] while
      David Ehrlich of IndieWire called her the film's "MVP," despite her brief
      screen time.[55] In August, she appeared in the music video for the song
      "Versace on the Floor" by Bruno Mars.[56]
