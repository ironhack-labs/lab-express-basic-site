                Neil Gaiman best known works are Coraline, Sandman and Neverwhere. <br>
                These are his most devestating wrestling moves. Legend says that once Gaiman used the Neverwhere on Chuck Norris, who shed a single tear. The tear was polished, for Chuck Norris cries only diamonds, and now sits atop the Queen of England's crown as gift from Neil Gaiman to apologise for when his move, the Coraline, wiped out Yorkshire.
