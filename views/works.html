    <h1>Works</h1>
    <p>Isaac Newton was a physicist and mathematician who developed the principles of modern physics, including the laws
        of
        motion and is credited as one of the great minds of the 17th-century Scientific Revolution.

        In 1687, he published his most acclaimed work, Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical
        Principles of
        Natural Philosophy), which has been called the single most influential book on physics. In 1705, he was knighted
        by
        Queen Anne of England, making him Sir Isaac Newton.</p>
