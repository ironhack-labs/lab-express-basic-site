            Steve Jobs was not your typical Silicon Valley CEO. Unlike most tech
            companies founders, he had neither any engineering experience nor
            any business training. After all, he dropped out of college after
            one semester! Few people know that Steve Jobs was never CEO of Apple
            in his first run there: the company was run by older executives and
            investors, and Steve Jobs actually helped them hire an experienced,
            'well-rounded' CEO in 1983, John Sculley. However, Jobs was kicked
            out of Apple by Sculley two years later and he watched him bring the
            company to naught during his tenure.

            Steve Jobs was Pixar's main investor for exactly twenty years, minus
            one week: he incorporated it on Feb 6, 1986, and sold it to Disney
            on Jan 24, 2006. However, his involvement with the company varied
            greatly throughout his life. Until 1993, he was mostly involved with
            NeXT, as an early employee recalled: "Steve was never involved in
            the day-to-day at Pixar [...]. There were large stretches of time,
            even in Richmond, where we never saw him around. (Someone spotted
            him up there one day driving around, trying to remember where our
            driveway entrance was.) NeXT and, later, Apple, kept him pretty
            busy." His most hands-on period with Pixar was between 1995 and
            1997, between the finishing touches on Toy Story and his comeback at
            Apple.
