    <h1>This is the collection of Gramsci' work üìö </h1>
    <p>Gramsci was one of the most important Marxist thinkers of the 20th century, and a particularly key thinker in the development of Western Marxism. 
        He wrote more than 30 notebooks and 3,000 pages of history and analysis during his imprisonment. 
        These writings, known as the Prison Notebooks, contain Gramsci's tracing of Italian history and nationalism, as well as some ideas in Marxist theory, critical theory and educational theory associated with his name, such as:
        <ul>
        <li>Cultural hegemony as a means of maintaining and legitimising the capitalist state</li>
        <li>An analysis of the modern capitalist state that distinguishes between political society, which dominates directly and coercively, and civil society, where leadership is constituted through consent</li>
        <li>Absolute historicism</li>
        <li>A critique of economic determinism that opposes fatalistic interpretations of Marxism</li>
        <li>A critique of philosophical materialism</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
