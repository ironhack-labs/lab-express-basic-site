        <h2>The First Programmer</h2>
        <p>
          Lovelace is believed by some to be the first to recognise that the
          Analytical Machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and to
          have published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such
          a machine. As a result, she is often regarded as the first to
          recognise the full potential of computer and as one the first to be a
          computer programmer.
        </p>

        <h2>Ada and the first algorithm</h2>
        <p>
          When she was a teenager, her mathematical talents led her to a long
          working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician
          Charles Babbage, who is known as "the father of computers". She was in
          particular interested in Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine.
          Lovelace first met him in June 1833, through their mutual friend, and
          her private tutor, Mary Somerville.
        </p>
        <p>
          Between 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by Italian military
          engineer Luigi Menabrea on the calculating engine, supplementing it
          with an elaborate set of notes, simply called "Notes". Lovelace's
          notes are important in the early history of computers, containing what
          many consider to be the first computer programâ€”that is, an algorithm
          designed to be carried out by a machine.

        <p>
          In her notes, Ada Lovelace emphasised the difference between the
          Analytical Engine and previous calculating machines, particularly its
          ability to be programmed to solve problems of any complexity. She
          realised the potential of the device extended far beyond mere number
          crunching. In her notes, she wrote:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            [The Analytical Engine] might act upon other things besides number,
            were objects found whose mutual fundamental relations could be
            expressed by those of the abstract science of operations, and which
            should be also susceptible of adaptations to the action of the
            operating notation and mechanism of the engine...Supposing, for
            instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the
            science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of
            such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate
            and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or
            extent.
          </p>
