        His early works, under the tutelage of the Spanish painter Anglada Camarasa, were stylistically close to
        impressionism.
        Around 1910, influenced both by cubism and by futurism, he became one of the first modern Portuguese painters.
        His style
        is aggressive and vivid both in form and colour and his works may seem random or chaotic in their compositional
        structure at first sight but are clearly defined and balanced. His more innovative paintings, such as "Trou de
        la
        Serrure", resemble collages and seem to pave the way to abstractionism or even dadaism.

        In 1912 he published an album with twenty drawings, and copied the story of Gustave Flaubert, "La Légende de
        Saint
        Julien to l'Hospitalier", in a calligraphic manuscript with illustrations, but these early works attracted
        little
        notice. In 1913 he exhibited eight works in the Armory Show in the US, some of which are now in American
        museums. The
        following year, he returned to Portugal and initiated a great and meteoric career in the experimentation of new
        forms of
        expression.

        In 1917 Amadeo and other artists such as Santa-Rita and Fernando Pessoa participated in the magazine Portugal
        Futurista,
        which had only one edition published. In 1916, he displayed in Oporto 114 artworks with the heading
        "Abstraccionism",
        that also was displayed in Lisbon, one and another with newness and some scandal. Cubism was in expansion
        throughout
        Europe and was an important influence in his analytical cubism. Amadeo de Souza Cardoso explored expressionism
        and in
        his last works he tried new techniques and other forms of plastic expression.

        In 1925, a retrospective exhibition in France of the painter's artwork was well received by the public and
        critics. Ten years later in Portugal, an award was created to distinguish modern painters: the
        Souza-Cardoso prize.

        Some of Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso's ink drawings, decorative but always figurative, slightly resemble those of
        Aubrey
        Beardsley.
