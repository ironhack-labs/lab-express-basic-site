                Jordan began his professional career with one of the most statistically impressive rookie campaigns in NBA history. Jordan waited for all of 9 games before his first-ever 40-point game. He scored more than twenty points in sixteen of his first twenty games and ended the year averaging 28.2 points per game average, good for third place in the entire league, behind only Bernard King and Larry Bird.

Jordan won Rookie of the Year easily in his first year and was unanimously voted by fans to be a starter in the NBA All-Star game in his rookie year. While Jordan had already won the favor of basketball fans, he saw jealousy and pushback from some of his NBA peers.

There was a group of players, led by veteran Isaiah Thomas, that discussed freezing Jordan out of possessions during the game because they were not pleased with the amount of attention the young rookie was receiving from the league. While Jordan was never the friendliest player the league had seen, he would win over the respect of every single NBA player throughout his NBA career.

Not only was Jordan statistically impressing his peers and the league, but also culturally changing the way people viewed him. It took him less than two months to make the cover of Sports Illustrated, the most prestigious sports publication of the time, and the cover read “A Star is Born.” To say that Jordan’s career started off with a bang was truly an understatement.
1985-1987: Crossroads
Jordan’s rookie year helped set the stage for what was to come from the young superstar, however the hype would take a brief hiatus in his second year when he broke his foot just three games into the season. He ended up only playing 18 regular season games but the real myth of MJ began in the 1985-86 playoffs when the Bulls faced off against the dynasty Boston Celtics. The Bulls were swept in the series but Jordan excelled, especially in Game 2 where he set an NBA record of scoring 63 points; a record that still stands today.

Jordan’s 1986-87 year was one of the most impressive in league history becoming the first player since Wilt Chamberlain to score 3,000 points in a season and going on to average a staggering 37 points per game.

Jordan also began impressing on the defensive end of the court, recording over 200 steals and 100 blocks during the season. His Bulls won 40 games and made it to the playoffs only to be swept by the Celtics for the third year in a row. He also took home the 1987 Slam Dunk Contest crown after his iconic foul line dunk.
1988-1990: Playing the “Bad Boys”
Jordan’s regular-season dominance continued and he also began deliberately working on becoming a more complete player. In 1987-88, he put up arguably his most complete stat line: 35 ppg, 5.5 rpg, 5.9 apg, 3.2 spg, and 1.6 bpg.

He won both league MVP and Defensive Player of the Year and the Bulls rode that momentum into the playoffs. They would run into a more complete team in the Detroit Pistons, dubbed the “Bad Boys” due to their extremely physical play. The Pistons physically wore Jordan and the Bulls down towards a 4-1 series win.

In 1988-89, Jordan again continued to dominate the league during the regular season. He averaged 32 points, 8 rebounds, and 8 assists on his way to his second consecutive MVP award. The league was beginning to recognize the talents of Jordan and was starting to respect just how good, and popular among the fans, he was.

Unfortunately, the Bulls met the Detroit Pistons again in the playoffs, this time in the Eastern Conference Finals. Jordan’s toughness and resolve were improving and the Bulls learned how to compete with the Pistons. It was glaring that, no matter how much Jordan could do individually, he needed more help from his team. He averaged 30 points in the series and his team took the Pistons to 6 games this time, but they lost and were sent home by them for a second straight year.

After two straight years of losing to the Pistons, the Bulls front office made a coaching change that would change the fortune of the Bulls for the next decade, replacing Doug Collins with former NBA Champion Phil Jackson. The change helped the Bulls click like they hadn’t yet and Jordan had another statistically historic season averaging almost 34 points, 7 rebounds, and 3 steals.

The Bulls won 55 games, and handily beat both the Bucks and 76ers en route to a third consecutive meeting with the Detroit Pistons. Even though the Bulls began getting Jordan some offensive and defensive help in young talent like Horace Grant and Scottie Pippen, the Pistons were still the better team. Jordan averaged 32 points in the series and the Bulls pushed the Pistons to seven games, but still fell short.

The big question among the media was whether or not Jordan would ever get past the Pistons, or if his legacy would always be that of a great player without the leadership and championship pedigree necessary to win a title. That narrative would be ridiculed for the rest of Jordan’s career after the eight-year run he was about to rip off.
1991-1993: Three-Peat
In 1990-91 Jordan won his third MVP, after Magic Johnson won the previous two, and the Bulls won a franchise-record 61 games, good enough for first place in the Eastern Conference. They handily took care of the Knicks and 76ers in the first two rounds, which set up another matchup between them and the Pistons.

The Bulls swept the Pistons in four games behind the play of Jordan and newly established All-Star Scottie Pippen. The win closed a somewhat long circle for Jordan as Pistons star point guard Isaiah Thomas led the Eastern Conference veterans in freezing the then-rookie out in the 1984 All-Star game. Isaiah was not pleased with the superstar as he led the Pistons to walk out of their Game 4 loss without shaking the hands of the Bulls players. Jordan and Thomas’ relationship was always a rocky one and their animosity towards each other would not end until well after their playing careers.

The Bulls entered the NBA Finals against the Lakers with great momentum. They had lost only one game so far in the playoffs and had just come off sweeping their longtime rival Pistons. That momentum would not end with the Pistons as the Bulls completed their most successful season in franchise history with a sweep of the Lakers on the way to winning their first-ever NBA Championship. This victory was also a personal one for Jordan as Magic Johnson and he had traded MVP awards back and forth for the last five years while Jordan, and many others in and around the league, believed he was the best player in the league each year.

Once the Bulls had gotten the Pistons monkey off their backs they were unstoppable for the next two years. They won 67 and 57 games respectively in the next two years and dominated playoff play towards their next two trips to the NBA Finals.

In 1992, the Bulls faced off against the Portland Trailblazers in the NBA Finals. The Trailblazers were led by Clyde Drexler, an All-Star who, several times during his career, was compared to Jordan due to them playing the same position and Drexler’s stellar athletic ability.

The ultra-competitive Jordan, always looking for a new grudge to hold, was not pleased with the comparison to Drexler, and torched the Blazers. He scored 35 points in the first half of Game 1, hitting 6 three-pointers, on the way to a rout of the Blazers. The Blazers hung tough with the Bulls, winning Game 2 and Game 4, but were overmatched in the series. Jordan won Finals MVP averaging 36 points for the series.
