    <p>His greatest work, earning him a Canonisation from the Catholic Church, the Sexual Healing Dance cleanses an individual's soul of all shames, guilts and regrets, inducing a permanent state of bliss that has been descrived by pope Benedict XVI as "the closest a man could ever feel to God in this foul Earth we inhabit".</p>
    <h2>Tantric bonding dance</h2>

    <p>Specially developed for couples with dep trust issues, the Tantric Boding Dance connects the souls of two individuals and creates an ethereal eternal bond that provides endless sexual bliss regardless of the circumstances.</p>
