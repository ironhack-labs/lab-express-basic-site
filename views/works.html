                  Niknam founded its first technology company TransIP in 2003. This company specializes in domain name registration and web hosting and has the largest market share in the Netherlands.
                  In 2007 he founded the company The Datacenter Group together with two partners . There he is mainly active in the background as a shareholder.
                  Niknam started its third company called bunq in 2012 . For this he has received a license from De Nederlandsche Bank . 
                  This was possible because TransIP was able to guarantee the required 17 million euros, making him the founder and sole shareholder of this mobile bank. 
                  Since then he has appeared extensively in the media to publicize his new company.
                  In 2014 Niknam handed over the day-to-day management of TransIP.
