        <p>I wish I could tell you all the incredible deeds of Gollum, but he didn't do anything worth telling. He's basically been a <span>pain in the a**</span> for everyone reading the books or watching the movies because he's just a Ring-addict ready
            to do anything to get "His Precious" back and go back to his miserable cave.</p>
