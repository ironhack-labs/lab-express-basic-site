            <p class="card-text">In Attack of the Clones, set 10 years later, Obi-Wan is now a respected Jedi Knight and
              the master of Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen). Over the years, Anakin has grown powerful but
              arrogant, and believes that Obi-Wan is "holding him back". After they save Padmé, now a senator, from an
              assassination attempt, Obi-Wan goes on a solo mission to trace the would-be assassins involved to the
              planet Kamino. He learns of a massive clone army that the planet's inhabitants are building for the
              Republic. The clones' template is bounty hunter Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison), and he and Obi-Wan battle
              once the latter deduces Fett must be behind the attempted assassination. Fett escapes to the planet
              Geonosis with his clone son Boba (Daniel Logan), unaware that Obi-Wan has pursued them.</p>

            <p class="card-text">In Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, set 32 years before A New Hope, a
              25-year-old Obi-Wan Kenobi appears as the Padawan apprentice of Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam
              Neeson).[13][d] He accompanies his master in negotiations with the corrupt Trade Federation, which is
              blockading the planet Naboo with a fleet of spaceships. They fight a swarm of battle droids and stow away
              on a landing craft en route to Naboo. Once on Naboo, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon rescue Naboo's Queen Padmé
              Amidala (Natalie Portman), with help from native Gungan Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best), and escape in a
              spaceship toward the Republic capital of Coruscant. Their ship is damaged in the escape, causing the
              hyperdrive generator to malfunction, and they land on Tatooine, where they discover the nine-year-old
              slave Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd). Qui-Gon believes the boy is the "Chosen One" prophesied to bring
              balance to the Force. Anakin joins the group as they travel to Coruscant. While leaving Tatooine, they are
              attacked by Darth Maul (portrayed by Ray Park, voiced by Peter Serafinowicz), a member of the Sith, a cult
              of the dark side long thought to be extinct.</p>

            <p class="card-text">In Return of the Jedi, Obi-Wan again appears to Luke after Yoda's death on Dagobah.
              Obi-Wan acknowledges that Darth Vader is indeed Luke's father, revealed by Vader himself in the previous
              film and confirmed by Yoda on his deathbed, and also reveals that Leia is Luke's twin sister. He urges
              Luke to confront and defeat Vader; Luke once more rejects his advice. After the Rebels destroy the second
              Death Star and defeat the Empire, Obi-Wan appears at the celebration on Endor, alongside the spirits of
              Yoda and the redeemed Anakin Skywalker (Sebastian Shaw).</p>

            <p class="card-text">In The Empire Strikes Back, Obi-Wan Kenobi appears several times as a spirit through
              the Force. On the ice planet Hoth, he appears to instruct Luke to go to the planet Dagobah to find the
              exiled Jedi Master Yoda (Frank Oz). Despite Yoda's skepticism, Obi-Wan convinces his old master to
              continue Luke's training. Obi-Wan appears later to beseech Luke not to leave Dagobah to try to rescue his
              friends on Cloud City, although Luke ignores this advice.</p>
