                Street photography, also sometimes called candid photography, is    photography conducted for art or enquiry that features     unmediated chance encounters and random incidents within public     places. Although there is a difference between street and candid    photography, it is usually subtle with most street photography     being candid in nature and some candid photography being    classifiable as street photography.

                Street photography does not necessitate the presence of a street or even the urban environment. Though people usually feature directly, street photography might be absent of people and can be of an object or environment where the image projects a decidedly human character in facsimile or aesthetic.
