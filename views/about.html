      While Rubik became famous for inventing the Rubik's Cube and his other
      puzzles, much of his recent work involves the promotion of science in
      education. Rubik is involved with several organisations such as Beyond
      Rubik's Cube, the Rubik Learning Initiative and the Judit Polgar
      Foundation all of whose aim is to engage students in science, mathematics,
      and problem solving at a young age.
