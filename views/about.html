                <h2>Ferran Adrià</h2>
                <p>Chef &amp; Genius</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Ferran Adrià Acosta (born May 14, 1962) is a Spanish
                    chef. He was
                    the head chef of the elBulli restaurant in Roses on the Costa Brava and is considered one of the
                    best
                    chefs in
                    the world. He has often collaborated with his brother, renowned pastry chef Albert Adrià.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Adrià began his culinary career in 1980 during his stint as a dishwasher at
                    the Hotel Playafels,
                    in
                    the town of Castelldefels. The chef de cuisine at this hotel taught him traditional Spanish
                    cuisine. At
                    19 he
                    was drafted into military service where he worked as a cook. In 1984, at the age of 22, Adrià
                    joined the
                    kitchen staff of elBulli as a line cook. Eighteen months later he became the head chef.

            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p class="text-justify">Along with British chef Heston Blumenthal, Adrià is often associated with
                    "molecular gastronomy",
                    although
                    like Blumenthal the Spanish chef does not consider his cuisine to be of this category.
                    Instead, he
                    has
                    referred to his cooking as deconstructivist. He defines the term as 'Taking a dish that is
                    well known
                    and
                    transforming all its ingredients, or part of them; then modifying the dish's texture, form
                    and/or its
                    temperature. Deconstructed, such a dish will preserve its essence... but its appearance will be
                    radically
                    different from the original's.' His stated goal is to "provide unexpected contrasts of
                    flavour,
                    temperature
                    and texture. Nothing is what it seems. The idea is to provoke, surprise and delight the diner."
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">elBulli was only open for about six months of the year, from mid-June to
                    mid-December. Adrià spent the remaining six months of the year perfecting recipes in the workshop
                    "elBulliTaller" in Barcelona. The restaurant closed on July 30, 2011. It reopened as a creativity
                    center to foster innovation like his own and entirely new ideas in 2014.</p>

            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p class="text-justify">elBulli had 3 Michelin stars and was one of the best restaurants in the world.
                    It received first
                    place in the Restaurant Top 50 in 2002. Then in 2005, it ranked second. It was again awarded the
                    first place in 2006, and retained this title in 2007, 2008 and 2009, making a record 5 times in the
                    top spot. In 2010, after elBulli announced it would close for good the next season, the title was
                    awarded to Noma of Copenhagen, Denmark.
                </p>

                <p class="text-justify">Adrià is well known for creating "culinary foam." Adrià explored foams created
                    without the addition of cream or egg white; foams are made of a flavoured liquid and an additive
                    (such as lecithin), then aerated through a variety of methods, including whipping with an immersion
                    blender or extrusion from a siphon bottle equipped with N2O cartridges. Further culinary processes
                    (such as freeze-drying or freezing with liquid nitrogen) may be applied to foams as well. Using a
                    single flavoured liquid allows the flavour of the final product to be less diluted and thus more
                    intense.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">Adrià is the author of several cookbooks including A Day at El Bulli, El Bulli
                    2003–2004 and Cocinar
                    en Casa (Cooking at Home). With his young assistant Daniel Picard, Adrià has made almonds into
                    cheese and asparagus into bread with the help of natural ingredients.</p>
