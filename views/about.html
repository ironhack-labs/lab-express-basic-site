        <h1>Who's Carlton Banks?</h1>
        <img src="/images/Carlton_Dance.gif" />

        <p>Carlton is a world-renowned sexual healing guru, whose unique soul-blooming dance technique earned him a
            Canonisation from the Vatican in 2014.</p>

        <h2>Early years</h2>
        <img src="/images/baby carlton.jpg" />
        <p>Baby Carlton was born on April the 1st 1988 to an upper class family in Bel Air, Los Angeles, USA. He was a
            beloved and cherished child and enjoyed a happy childhood, which would set the first steps towards his
            brilliant career.</p>
        <h2>Late teens: Great expectations</h2>
        <img src="/images/basketball.jpg" />
        <p>Despite his limited stature, young Carlton would develop a massive talent for sports, mainly basketball. This
            joyful era, however, would not last. His career would end abruptly on 2005, when, on an international
            match against the Republic of the Congo, he would break both kneecaps on an unfortunate clash with an
            audience member.</p>
        <h2>From the pitch to the spotlight</h2>
        <img src="/images/jackson.jpg" />
        <p>That accident would mark the end of Carlton's career as an elite athlete, but would only be the start of his
            notoriety. Having cemented his position as one of the US' greatest personalities, Carlton would be a regular
            at all of Hollywood's parties, sharing the bling with the brightests stars of the moment.</p>
        <h2>Bad boy era</h2>
        <img src="/images/carlton jail.gif" />
        <p>Sharing the bling, unfortunately, led to Carlton rubbing shoulders amongst some not-so-good people, and
            taking part in shady deals, not for wealth, but for the thrill of it. This downward spiral would end with
            Carlton serving 10 years in jail for manslaughter and indecent exposure.</p>
        <h2>A new man emerges from jail</h2>
        <img src="/images/arevalo.png" />
        <p>The quietude of jail provided Carlton with the perfect athmosphere to reconsider his life choices. After
            getting in contact with a saucy latino philosopher inmate, Carlton started exploring the depths of his soul,
            and emerged as a renovated man, leading him to develop his trademark sexual healing dance methodology.</p>
        <h2>Canonisation</h2>
        <img src="/images/jesuscarlton.jpg" alt="">
        <p>His works as a sexual healing guru lead to the miraculous healing and enhornyment of millions of people,
            leading the Catholic Church to officialy canonise him on 2014.</p>
