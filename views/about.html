    <h1>About me</h1>

    <p>John Peter Petrucci (born July 12, 1967) is an American guitarist, composer and producer. He is best known as a founding member of the progressive metal band Dream Theater. He produced or co-produced (often with former member Mike Portnoy before he departed the band in 2010) all Dream Theater albums from 1999's Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory to 2019's Distance Over Time. He has been the sole producer of the band's albums released since Portnoy's departure in 2010. Petrucci was named as the third player on the G3 tour seven times, more than any other invited guitarist. Joel McIver's 2009 book The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists ranks Petrucci second, after Dave Mustaine.[1] He was also named as one of the "Top 10 Greatest Guitar Shredders of All Time" by GuitarOne magazine.[2] In 2012, Petrucci was ranked the 17th greatest guitarist of all time by a Guitar World magazine reader's poll</p>
