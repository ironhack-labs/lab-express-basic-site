    <p>
      Aang was a Air Nomad born in 12 BG and the Avatar during the century-long
      conflict known as the Hundred Year War. His immediate predecessor was
      Avatar Roku, and his immediate successor is Avatar Korra. As the Avatar of
      his time, he was the only person capable of using all four bending arts:
      airbending, waterbending, earthbending, and firebending. He was also one
      of a select few Avatars, and one of the first in many cycles to learn the
      ancient art of energybending, and the first Avatar known to have actively
      used the technique.
