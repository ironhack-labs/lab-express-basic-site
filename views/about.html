    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the Second Chance SPCA. Since 2006 we have operated Plano's Premier No-Kill Animal Shelter.
        Our mission is to rescue at-risk cats and dogs from local municipal shelters. We supply them with needed medical
        care, food and shelter. Just as important, we provide all of our cats and dogs with the love and attention they
        deserve until they are placed into their "forever homes".

        Come visit us and adopt your newest family member today! Everyone deserves a second chance!<p>
