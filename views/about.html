            Barack Obama served as the 44th President of the United States. His story is the American story — values
            from
            the heartland, a middle-class upbringing in a strong family, hard work and education as the means of getting
            ahead, and the conviction that a life so blessed should be lived in service to others.

        <p class="about-p">
            When Barack Obama was elected president in 2008, he became the first African American to hold the office.
            The framers of the Constitution always hoped that our leadership would not be limited to Americans of wealth
            or
            family connections. Subject to the prejudices of their time—many of them owned slaves—most would not have
            foreseen an African American president. <br> Obama’s father, Barack Sr., a Kenyan economist, met his mother,
            Stanley
            Ann Dunham, when both were students in Hawaii, where Barack was born on August 4, 1961. They later divorced,
            and
            Barack’s mother married a man from Indonesia, where he spent his early childhood. Before fifth grade, he
            returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents and attend Punahou School on scholarship. <br>
            <br>
            In his memoir Dreams from My Father (1995), Obama describes the complexities of discovering his identity in
            adolescence. After two years at Occidental College in Los Angeles, he transferred to Columbia University,
            where he studied political science and international relations. Following graduation in 1983, Obama worked
            in New
            York City, then became a community organizer on the South Side of Chicago, coordinating with churches to
            improve
            housing conditions and set up job-training programs in a community hit hard by steel mill closures. <br> In
            1988,
            he
            went to Harvard Law School, where he attracted national attention as the first African American president of
            the
            Harvard Law Review. Returning to Chicago, he joined a small law firm specializing in civil rights.
