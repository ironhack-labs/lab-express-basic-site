    <h1>About üå¨üèî</h1>
    <p>
      Alex is an American rock climber best known for his free solo ascents of big
      walls, in particular his soloing El Capitan, in Yosemite National Park in
      2017. Alex is the only person to have free solo-climbed El
      Capitan, and holds the fastest ascent of the Yosemite triple crown,
      an 18-hour, 50-minute link-up of Mount Watkins, The Nose, and the Regular
      Northwest Face of Half Dome. Alex says he likes tall, long routes
      and that he tries to do them quickly. He is the author (with David
      Roberts) of the memoir Alone on the Wall (2017) and the subject of the
      2018 biographical documentary Free Solo, which won a BAFTA.

    <h3>"Climbing El Capitan was hard but not as hard as completing the WD Bootcamp from Ironhack"</h3>
    <p>It was supposedly said by Alex after climbing El Capitan without ropes for the second time</p>
