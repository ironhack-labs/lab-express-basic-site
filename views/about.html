    <h1>About SpongeBob</h1>
    <p>A square yellow sponge named SpongeBob SquarePants lives in a pineapple with his pet snail, Gary, in the city of Bikini Bottom on the floor of the Pacific Ocean. He works as a fry cook at the Krusty Krab. During his time off, SpongeBob has a knack for attracting trouble with his starfish best friend, Patrick. Arrogant octopus Squidward Tentacles, SpongeBob's neighbor, dislikes SpongeBob because of his childlike behavior.</p>

    <ul id="fast-facts">
    <li>According to SpongeBob's driver's license, he was born July 14, 1986. But he was already living on his own—and trying to get a job at the Krusty Krab—when the SpongeBob show debuted in 1999.</li>
    <li>The recipe for Krabby Patties is a well-guarded secret, but creator Hillenburg has hinted that these mystery burgers may be vegetarian. Otherwise, some inhabitants of Bikini Bottom would be cannibals.</li>
    <li>SpongeBob always tries to do his best. He's now helping out the New York City Department of Environmental Protection by urging kids to help save water. The campaign features an enormous SpongeBob—swollen from absorbing an entire bathtub of water—with the slogan "Save Water—Don't Drip New York Dry!"</li>
