    <h2>Biografia</h2>
    <p>
      American singer, songwriter and producer Lady Gaga has recorded material
      for seven studio albums and three extended plays (EP), and has been
      featured on songs on other artists' respective albums. After being dropped
      from a solo contract with Def Jam Recordings, Gaga worked as a songwriter
      for Sony/ATV Music Publishing, where Akon helped her sign a joint deal
      with Interscope Records and his own label KonLive Distribution. After
      signing with Interscope, Gaga began working on her debut album The Fame,
      which was released in 2008. It produced the global chart-topping singles
      "Just Dance" and "Poker Face". She collaborated with different producers,
      primarily RedOne, Fernando Garibay, Martin Kierszenbaum, and Rob Fusari.
      The album has influences of the 1980s pop music and discusses Gaga's love
      for fame while also dealing with subjects such as love, sexuality, money
      and drugs.
