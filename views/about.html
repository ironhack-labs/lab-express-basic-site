                <h2>Ferran Adrià</h2>
                <p>Chef &amp; Genius</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Ferran Adrià Acosta (born May 14, 1962) is a Spanish
                    chef. He
                    was
                    the head chef of the elBulli restaurant in Roses on the Costa Brava and is considered one of the
                    best
                    chefs in
                    the world. He has often collaborated with his brother, renowned pastry chef Albert Adrià.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Adrià began his culinary career in 1980 during his stint as a dishwasher at
                    the Hotel Playafels,
                    in
                    the town of Castelldefels. The chef de cuisine at this hotel taught him traditional Spanish
                    cuisine. At
                    19 he
                    was drafted into military service where he worked as a cook. In 1984, at the age of 22, Adrià
                    joined the
                    kitchen staff of elBulli as a line cook. Eighteen months later he became the head chef.

                <p class="text-justify">Along with British chef Heston Blumenthal, Adrià is often associated with
                    "molecular gastronomy",
                    although
                    like Blumenthal the Spanish chef does not consider his cuisine to be of this category.[3]
                    Instead, he
                    has
                    referred to his cooking as deconstructivist.[4] He defines the term as 'Taking a dish that is
                    well known
                    and
                    transforming all its ingredients, or part of them; then modifying the dish's texture, form
                    and/or its
                    temperature. Deconstructed, such a dish will preserve its essence... but its appearance will be
                    radically
                    different from the original's.'[5] His stated goal is to "provide unexpected contrasts of
                    flavour,
                    temperature
                    and texture. Nothing is what it seems. The idea is to provoke, surprise and delight the diner."
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">In March 2012 he announced the new project he's working on:
                    LaBullipedia.[12] In a later
                    interview he
                    described as "A Western haute cuisine Wikipedia at the service of information but also
                    creativity".[13]
                    An art exhibition about Adrià and his restaurant: 'elBulli: Ferran Adrià and The Art of Food'
                    was hosted
                    at
                    Somerset House in London in 2013. The exhibition will be included in a new permanent museum
                    Adrià is set
                    to
                    open at the El Bulli Foundation in 2015
