      Nicholas D. Miller (born December 26, 1990), known professionally as
      Illenium (stylized in all caps), is an American musician, DJ, and record
      producer. He has released three studio albums with his most recent,
      Ascend, being released in August 2019 on Astralwerks. The album was
      Illenium's first to top the Billboard Dance/Electronic Albums chart and
      also reached his highest peak on the Billboard 200 at number 14. Several
      of Illenium's songs have appeared on the Billboard Hot Dance/Electronic
      Songs chart, including two singles in 2019 that peaked at number 3: "Good
      Things Fall Apart" with Jon Bellion and "Takeaway" with The Chainsmokers
      (featuring Lennon Stella). Illenium has also worked on numerous notable
      remixes, including those for The Chainsmokers' "Don't Let Me Down" and
      Flume's "Say It", the latter of which won the award for "Remix of the
      Year" at the inaugural Electronic Music Awards in 2017. He was included in
      the Forbes 30 Under 30 2020 Music list.
