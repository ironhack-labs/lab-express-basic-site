      <p>Lynn Margulis (born Lynn Petra Alexander; March 5, 1938 – November 22, 2011) was an American evolutionary
        theorist, biologist, science author, educator, and science popularizer, and was the primary modern proponent for
        the
        significance of symbiosis in evolution. Historian Jan Sapp has said that "Lynn Margulis's name is as synonymous
        with
        symbiosis as Charles Darwin's is with evolution." In particular, Margulis transformed and fundamentally framed
        current understanding of the evolution of cells with nuclei – an event Ernst Mayr called "perhaps the most
        important and
        dramatic event in the history of life" – by proposing it to have been the result of symbiotic mergers of
        bacteria.
        Margulis was also the co-developer of the Gaia hypothesis with the British chemist James Lovelock, proposing
        that the
        Earth functions as a single self-regulating system, and was the principal defender and promulgator of the five
        kingdom
        classification of Robert Whittaker.
