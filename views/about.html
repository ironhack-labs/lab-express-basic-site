    <p>Hawking was born in <a href="/wiki/Oxford" title="Oxford">Oxford</a> into a family of doctors. He began his university education at <a href="/wiki/University_College,_Oxford" title="University College, Oxford">University College, Oxford</a>, in October 1959 at the age of 17, where he received a <a href="/wiki/First_Class_Honours#First-class_honours" class="mw-redirect" title="First Class Honours">first-class</a> <a href="/wiki/Honours_degree" title="Honours degree">BA (Hons.) degree</a> in physics. He began his graduate work at <a href="/wiki/Trinity_Hall,_Cambridge" title="Trinity Hall, Cambridge">Trinity Hall, Cambridge</a>, in October 1962, where he obtained his <a href="/wiki/PhD" class="mw-redirect" title="PhD">PhD</a> degree in <a href="/wiki/Applied_mathematics" title="Applied mathematics">applied mathematics</a> and theoretical physics, specialising in <a href="/wiki/General_relativity" title="Lucasian Professor of Mathematics">general relativity</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cosmology" title="Cosmology">cosmology</a> in March 1966. In 1963, Hawking was diagnosed with an early-onset slow-progressing form of <a href="/wiki/Motor_neurone_disease" class="mw-redirect" title="">motor neurone disease</a> that gradually paralysed him over the decades.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:0_21-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-21">[21]</a></sup> After the loss of his speech, he communicated through a <a href="/wiki/Speech-generating_device" title="Speech-generating device">speech-generating device</a> initially through use of a handheld switch, and eventually by using a single cheek muscle.

    <p>Hawking's scientific works included a collaboration with <a href="/wiki/Roger_Penrose" title="Roger Penrose">Roger Penrose</a> on <a href="/wiki/Penrose%E2%80%93Hawking_singularity_theorems" title="Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems">gravitational singularity theorems</a> in the framework of <a href="/wiki/General_relativity" title="General relativity">general relativity</a> and the theoretical prediction that <a href="/wiki/Black_hole" title="Black hole">black holes</a> emit radiation, often called <a href="/wiki/Hawking_radiation" title="Hawking radiation">Hawking radiation</a>. Initially, Hawking radiation was controversial. By the late 1970s and following the publication of further research, the discovery was widely accepted as a significant breakthrough in theoretical physics. Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and <a href="/wiki/Quantum_mechanics" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>. He was a vigorous supporter of the <a href="/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation" title="Many-worlds interpretation">many-worlds interpretation</a> of <a href="/wiki/Quantum_mechanics" title="Robert Graves">quantum mechanics</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup>

    <p>Hawking achieved commercial success with several works of <a href="/wiki/Popular_science" title="Popular science">popular science</a> in which he discussed his theories and cosmology in general. His book <i><a href="/wiki/A_Brief_History_of_Time" title="A Brief History of Time">A Brief History of Time</a></i> appeared on the <i><a href="/wiki/The_Sunday_Times" title="">Sunday Times</a></i> bestseller list for a record-breaking 237 weeks.

In 2002, Hawking was ranked number 25 in the <a href="/wiki/BBC" title="BBC">BBC</a>'s poll of the <a href="/wiki/100_Greatest_Britons" title="">100 Greatest Britons</a>.
