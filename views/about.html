    <h1>Plot</h1>
    <span>
      <p>
        Son Goku, a monkey-tailed boy, and Bulma, a teenage girl, travel to find
        the seven Dragon Balls, which summon the dragon Shenlong to grant the
        user one wish. Their journey leads to the desert bandit Yamcha, who
        later becomes an ally; Chi-Chi, whom Goku unknowingly agrees to marry;
        and Pilaf, an impish man who seeks the Dragon Balls to fulfill his
        desire to rule the world. Goku undergoes rigorous training regimes under
        the martial arts master Kame-Sen'nin to fight in the Tenkaichi Budōkai
        (天下一武道会, lit. "Strongest Under the Heavens Martial Arts
        Tournament"). He becomes friends with a monk named Kuririn, his training
        partner and initial rival. After the tournament, Goku searches for the
        Dragon Ball his grandfather left him and almost single-handedly defeats
        the Red Ribbon Army and their hired assassin, Taopaipai. Goku then
        reunites with his friends to defeat the fortune teller Baba Uranai's
        fighters and use her to find the last Dragon Ball in order to revive a
        friend killed by Taopaipai.

        Three years later at the Tenkaichi Budōkai, Goku and his allies oppose
        Kame-Sen'nin's rival and Taopaipai's brother, Tsuru-Sen'nin, and his
        students Tenshinhan and Chaozu. Kuririn is killed after the tournament;
        Goku tracks down the murderer's leader, Piccolo Daimao, but is defeated.
        The samurai Yajirobe takes Goku to the hermit Karin, who heals him and
        gives him a power boost. Meanwhile, Piccolo defeats and kills
        Kame-Sen'nin and Chaozu before using the Dragon Balls to regain his
        youth and destroy Shenlong. Goku then kills Piccolo Daimao, who, before
        dying, spawns his son/reincarnation Piccolo. Karin then directs Goku to
        Kami, the original creator of the Dragon Balls and Piccolo Daimao's
        other half, to restore Shenlong and revive his slain friends. Goku
        trains under Kami for the next three years, once again reuniting with
        his friends at the Tenkaichi Budōkai. There, he defeats Piccolo, whose
        life he spares as it would also kill Kami. Goku leaves with Chi-Chi to
        keep his promise to marry her.

        Five years later, Goku is a young adult and father to a son, Gohan. A
        man named Raditz arrives on Earth, identifies Goku as his younger
        brother Kakarrot, and reveals to him that they are members of a nearly
        extinct extraterrestrial race called the Saiyans (サイヤ人, Saiya-jin),
        who sent Goku to conquer Earth for them; however, Goku had suffered a
        severe head injury as an infant and lost all memories of his mission.
        Goku refuses to continue the mission, and sides with Piccolo to kill
        Raditz at the cost of his own life. In the afterlife, Goku trains under
        the North Kaiō until he is revived by the Dragon Balls to save the Earth
        from the invading Nappa and Vegeta. In the battle, Yamcha, Chaozu,
        Tenshinhan, and Piccolo are killed, and the Dragon Balls cease to exist.
        Kuririn and the galactic tyrant Freeza learn of another set of Dragon
        Balls on the planet Namek (ナメック星, Namekku-sei), Piccolo's
        homeworld. Bulma, Gohan, and Kuririn search for them to revive their
        friends and restore Earth's Dragon Balls. Their goal leads to several
        battles with Freeza's minions and Vegeta, the latter standing alongside
        the heroes to fight the Ginyu Force, a team of mercenaries. The long
        battle with Freeza ends when Goku transforms into a legendary Super
        Saiyan (超サイヤ人, Sūpā Saiya-jin) and defeats him. Barely surviving,
        Freeza recovers and goes to Earth to take his revenge on Goku; however,
        he is killed by a Super Saiyan from the future named Trunks.

        Three years later, a group of Androids (人造人間, Jinzōningen, lit.
        "Artificial Humans") created by a member of the former Red Ribbon Army,
        Doctor Gero, appears, seeking revenge against Goku. During this time, an
        evil life form called Cell also emerges and, after absorbing two of the
        Androids to achieve his "perfect form", holds his own fighting
        tournament to challenge the protagonists. After Goku sacrifices his own
        life to no avail, Gohan avenges his father by killing Cell. Seven years
        later Goku, briefly revived for one day, and his allies are drawn into a
        fight against Majin Boo. After many battles, including the destruction
        and re-creation of the Earth, a resurrected Goku destroys Boo with a
        Genki-Dama (a sphere of pure energy drawn from all intelligent beings on
        Earth) and wishes for him to be reincarnated as a "good person". Ten
        years later, at the Tenkaichi Budōkai, Goku meets Boo's human
        reincarnation, Oob. After testing his powers, Goku departs with Oob to
        train him to be the Earth's new guardian.
