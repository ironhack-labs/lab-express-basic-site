    <h1>About Pavement</h1>

        <p class="longtext">
            Pavement was an American indie rock band that formed 
            in Stockton, California in 1989. The group's core members were 
            lead singer and writer Stephen Malkmus, 
            guitarist Scott Kannberg, bassist Mark Ibold, drummer Steve West and Bob Nastanovich. 
            Initially conceived as a recording project, the band initially avoided press or live performances, 
            while attracting considerable underground attention with their early releases. 
            Kown for pioneering indie and slacker culture music, the band experimented with 
            different sounds and ifluences and is noted for their satirical themes and dark humor.

        <p class="longtext">
            Pavement recorded five full-length albums 
            and ten EPs over the course of their decade-long career. 
            They disbanded with some acrimony in 1999 as the members moved on to other projects. 
            In 2010, they undertook a well-received reunion tour, and will perform two 30th 
            anniversary shows in 2022.
