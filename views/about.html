    <p>Without fear of anything Man de Barro emerges as a group of Ecuadorian musicians exploring a genre that is torn between tropical and pop. They began at the beginning of 2013 in Guayaquil, with a proposal inspired by organic sounds.</p>
    <p>
        Man de Barro is characterized by creating an atmosphere full of Groove that invades any stage and infects people with its rhythm. The objective of these young artists is to diversify the Ecuadorian musical product and thus achieve a distinction in the genre.</p>
