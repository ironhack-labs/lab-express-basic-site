                <h2>Early life</h2>
                <p>
                    Born in Amsterdam, Bergkamp was the last of Wim and Tonnie Bergkamp's four sons. He was brought up
                    in a working-class suburb, in a family aspiring to reach middle-class status. His father, an
                    electrician and amateur footballer in the lower leagues, named him in honour of Scottish striker Denis
                    Law. To comply with Dutch given name customs, an extra "n" was inserted in Bergkamp's first name by
                    his father after it was not accepted by the registrar. Bergkamp was raised as a Roman Catholic by
                    his family and regularly attended church during his childhood. Although in later years he said
                    visits to church did not appeal to him, Bergkamp still maintains his faith. According to Bergkamp,
                    his childhood footballing heroes were Glenn Hoddle, whom he admired for his soft precise touch, and
                    Johan Cruyff, who once coached him when he was twelve.

                <h2>Ajax</h2>
                <p>
                    Bergkamp was brought up through Ajax's youth system, joining the club at age 11. Manager Johan Cruyff
                    gave him his professional debut on 14 December 1986 against Roda JC; the match ended in a 2–0 victory
                    for Ajax. Bergkamp scored his first senior goal for the club against HFC Haarlem on 22 February 1987
                    in a match Ajax won 6–0. He went on to make 23 appearances in the 1986–87 season, including a
                    European debut against Malmö FF in the 1986–87 European Cup Winners' Cup, earning him praise. Ajax
                    won the competition, beating Lokomotive Leipzig 1–0 as Bergkamp made an appearance as a substitute.

                    In later seasons, Bergkamp established himself as a first-team player for Ajax. This culminated in a
                    period of success for the club, which won the Eredivisie title in the 1989–90 season for the first time
                    in five years. Bergkamp scored 29 goals in 36 matches the following season and became the joint top
                    goalscorer in the league, sharing the accolade with PSV striker Romário.

                    Ajax won the 1992 UEFA Cup Final, beating Torino through the away goals ruling. They then defeated
                    Heerenveen 6–2 in the final of the KNVB Cup on 20 May 1993. Bergkamp was the top scorer in the
                    Eredivisie from 1991 to 1993, and was voted Dutch Footballer of the Year in 1992 and 1993. In total,
                    he scored 122 goals in 239 matches for his hometown club.

                <h2>International career</h2>
                <p>
                    Bergkamp made his international debut for the Netherlands national team against Italy on 26 September
                    1990 as a substitute for Frank de Boer. He scored his first goal for the team against Greece on 21
                    November 1990. Bergkamp was selected for Euro 1992, where his national team were the defending
                    champions. Although Bergkamp impressed, scoring three goals in the tournament, the team lost on
                    penalties to eventual champions Denmark.


                    Bergkamp lines up prior to a Euro 1996 match against Scotland
                    In the qualification for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Bergkamp scored five goals and was selected for the
                    finals, staged in the United States. He featured in every game for the national team, getting goals
                    against Morocco in the group stages and the Republic of Ireland in the round-of-16. Bergkamp scored the
                    second goal for the Netherlands against Brazil, but the team lost 3–2, exiting in the
                    quarter-finals. At Euro 1996, Bergkamp scored against Switzerland and set up striker Patrick
                    Kluivert's consolation goal against England, who advanced into the quarter-finals.

                    Against Wales in the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualification on 9 November 1996, he scored his first hat-trick
                    for the national team. The Netherlands finished first in their group and qualified for the 1998 FIFA
                    World Cup, held in France. Bergkamp scored three times in the competition, including a memorable winning
                    goal in the final minute of the quarterfinal against Argentina. He took one touch to control a long
                    60-yard aerial pass from Frank de Boer, brought the ball down through Argentine defender Roberto Ayala's
                    legs, and finally finished by firing a volley with the outside of his right foot, past keeper Carlos Roa
                    at a tight angle from the right. The goal, cited by Bergkamp as his favourite in his career, was
                    his 36th for the national team, overtaking Faas Wilkes as the record goalscorer. In the semi-finals,
                    the Netherlands lost to Brazil on penalties after drawing 1–1 in normal time Bergkamp made the
                    All-Star team of the tournament, alongside Frank de Boer and Edgar Davids.

                    On 9 October 1999, Bergkamp scored his final goal for the Netherlands, against Brazil. As the
                    Netherlands were co-hosts for Euro 2000, the team automatically qualified for the tournament and were
                    considered favourites. In the semi-finals, the Netherlands lost 3–1 on penalties to Italy.
                    Following the defeat, Bergkamp announced his retirement from international football, choosing to focus
                    on his club career. His final goal tally of 37 goals in 79 appearances was overtaken by Patrick
                    Kluivert in June 2003.
