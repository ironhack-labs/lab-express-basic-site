    <h2>David Cloud Berman</h2>
    <h4>*January 4, 1967 – †August 7, 2019</h4>
    <p>
      was an American musician, singer, poet and
      cartoonist. In 1989, he founded the indie-rock band Silver Jews with Stephen Malkmus and Bob Nastanovich. He was
      the
      only constant member during the band's discography, which concluded in 2009, following the band's sixth and final
      album Lookout Mountain, Lookout Sea (2008). He provided the distinct lyricism and, alongside Malkmus, the sparsely
      simple country-rock sound—which developed from initial lo-fi recordings.
      He released his only book of poetry, Actual Air, in 1999. Around this time Berman began to take hard drugs;
      struggling with substance abuse, depression and anxiety—the latter directly influencing his career decisions. In
      2003, these factors culminated in a botched suicide attempt. He then undertook rehab, engaged with Judaism and
      embarked on the band's first tour with his then-wife, Cassie Berman.
      Although Berman's music and poetry was, relatively, successful, he experienced financial difficulties. This, along
      with the dissolution of his marriage, caused his return to music in 2019. Adopting a new band name, Purple
      Mountains, he released an eponymous debut album, that July. He then intended to tour the album and thus pay off
      his
      $100,000 credit card debt. He committed suicide in August.
      Despite believing his music to be unappreciated, he had acquired a reputation of being "perhaps the finest
      lyricist
      of his generation". Berman's lyrics were his creative priority; labouring over them for extended periods of time.
      They were abstract in nature and had become autobiographical in his later career, sung in a deep and monotone
      manner.
