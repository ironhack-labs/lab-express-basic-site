    <h1>Wolfgang Tillmans</h1>
    <p>
      Wolfgang Tillmans is an influential contemporary German artist. Emerging
      in the 1990s with his snapshot documentations of youths, clubs, and LGBTQ
      culture, Tillman’s practice has expanded to include diaristic photography,
      large-scale abstraction, and commissioned magazine work. “I want the
      pictures to be working in both directions,” the artist has said. “I accept
      that they speak about me, and yet at the same time, I want and expect them
      to function in terms of the viewer and their experience.” Capturing
      landscapes from an airplane window, still lifes of crustaceans, and
      portraits, his work conveys the profundity of an exhaustive archive. Born
      on August 16, 1968 in Remscheid, West Germany, Tillmans spent the early
      part of his career in London after graduating from the Bournemouth and
      Poole College of Art and Design. In 2000, he was awarded the prestigious
      Turner Prize, marking the first time the prize had been awarded to a
      photographer or non-British artist. In 2006 Tillmans established Between
      Bridges, a non-profit exhibition space located in Berlin. In 2017, the
      survey show “Wolfgang Tillmans: 2017” opened at the Tate Modern in London
      to critical acclaim. The artist currently lives and works between Berlin,
      Germany and London, United Kingdom. His works are presently held in the
      collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, The Museum of Modern Art in
      New York, the Hamburger Bahnhof in Berlin, and the Kunstmuseum Basel,
      among others.
