          Jobs was raised by adoptive parents in Cupertino, California, located
          in what is now known as Silicon Valley. Though he was interested in
          engineering, his passions of youth varied. He dropped out of Reed
          College, in Portland, Oregon, took a job at Atari Corporation as a
          video game designer in early 1974, and saved enough money for a
          pilgrimage to India to experience Buddhism.

          Back in Silicon Valley in the autumn of 1974, Jobs reconnected with
          Stephen Wozniak, a former high school friend who was working for the
          Hewlett-Packard Company. When Wozniak told Jobs of his progress in
          designing his own computer logic board, Jobs suggested that they go
          into business together, which they did after Hewlett-Packard formally
          turned down Wozniak’s design in 1976. The Apple I, as they called the
          logic board, was built in the Jobses’ family garage with money they
          obtained by selling Jobs’s Volkswagen minibus and Wozniak’s
          programmable calculator.
