    <p>Aubrey Drake Graham (born October 24, 1986)
      [3]
      is a Canadian rapper,
      singer, songwriter, actor, and entrepreneur.
      [4] Drake initially gained
      recognition as an actor on the teen drama television series Degrassi: The Next
      Generation in the early 2000s.
      Intent on pursuing a career as a rapper, he departed the series in 2007
      following the release of his debut mixtape, Room for Improvement. He
      released two further independent projects, Comeback Season and So Far Gone,
      before signing to Lil Wayne's Young Money Entertainment in June 2009.
      [5]
      Drake released his debut studio album Thank Me Later in 2010,
      [6] which
      debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 and was soon certified
      platinum by the RIAA. His next two releases, 2011's Take Care and 2013's
      Nothing Was the Same,
      [7][8] were both critically and commercially successful;
      the former earned him his first Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. In 2015,
      he released two mixtapes—the trap-influenced If You're Reading This It's Too
      Late and a collaboration with Future titled What a Time to Be Alive—both of
      which earned platinum certification in the U.S.
      [9]
      His fourth album, Views (2016), broke several chart records.
      [10] The dancehallinfluenced
      album sat atop the Billboard 200 for thirteen nonconsecutive
      weeks,
      [11] becoming the first album by a male solo artist to do so in over ten
      years. The album's second single, "One Dance", topped the charts in several
      countries, including the US, the UK, and Canada, where it became his first
      number one single as a lead artist. That year, Drake lead both the Billboard Hot
      100 and the Billboard 200 charts simultaneously for eight weeks.
      [12] Views
      achieved quadruple platinum status in the US, and earned over 1 million
      album-equivalent units in the first week of its release.
      [13][14] Its lead single
      "Hotline Bling" received Grammy Awards for Best Rap/Sung Performance and
      Best Rap Song.
      [15] In 2017, he released the mixtape More Life. Described by
      Drake as a "playlist",
      [16][17]
      it became his seventh consecutive number one on
      the Billboard 200, and set multiple streaming records.
      [18] A year later, he
      released the double album Scorpion, which also broke several streaming
      records.
      [19]
      Drake holds several Billboard chart records. He has the most charted songs
      (154) among solo artists in the history of the Billboard Hot 100, the most
      simultaneously charted Hot 100 songs in a single week (24), the most time on
      the Hot 100 (431 weeks) and the most Hot 100 debuts in a week (21).
      [20] He
      also has the most number one singles on the Hot Rap Songs, Hot R&B/HipHop
      Airplay and Rhythmic Charts.
      [21][22] Drake has also won three Juno
      Awards, six American Music Awards, a record thirteen Billboard Music
      Awards, and is one of the best-selling artists of all time, with over 2

      Early life
      Aubrey Drake Graham was born on
      October 24, 1986, in Toronto, Ontario.
      His father, Dennis Graham, is an African
      American and a practising Catholic from
      Memphis, Tennessee, and worked as a
      drummer, performing alongside country
      musician Jerry Lee Lewis.
      [27][28] Drake's
      mother, Sandra "Sandi" Graham (née
      Sher), is an Ashkenazi Jewish Canadian
      who worked as an English teacher and
      florist.
      [29][30][31][32][33] His parents met
      after Dennis performed at Clue Bluenote
      in Toronto, where he first interacted with Sandra, who was in attendance.
      [34] In his youth, Drake attended a Jewish day
      school, and had a Bar Mitzvah ceremony.
      [35][36][37][38][39] He is also a dual citizen of the United States and Canada.
      [40]
      Drake's parents divorced when he was five years old. After the divorce, he and his mother remained in Toronto, while his
      father returned to Memphis, where he suffered incarceration for a number of years on drug-related charges.
      [41] Dennis'
      limited finances and legal issues caused him to remain in the United States until Drake's early adulthood.
      [35][36][37] Prior to
      his arrest, however, Dennis would travel to Toronto and bring Drake to Memphis every summer.
      [42][43][44] His father later
      collaborated with Canadian music group Arkells on the music video for a song entitled "Drake's Dad".
      [45]
      Drake was raised in two polarizing Toronto neighbourhoods; he lived on Weston Road in the city's working-class west
      end,
      [43] until grade six. In his youth, he played minor hockey with the Weston Red Wings.
      [46] Drake then moved to one of
      the city's affluent neighbourhoods, Forest Hill, in 2000.
      [47][48] When asked about the move, Drake replied, "[We had] a half
      of a house we could live in. The other people had the top half, we had the bottom half. I lived in the basement, my mom
      lived on the first floor. It was not big, it was not luxurious. It was what we could afford."
      [49]
      He attended Forest Hill Collegiate Institute, where he demonstrated an affinity for the arts, first acting while an active
      student at the school.
      [50] He later attended Vaughan Road Academy in the city's multicultural Oakwood–Vaughan
      neighbourhood. Due to the economic status associated with the neighbourhood, Drake described the school as "not by any
      means the easiest school to go to. [It's tough]."
      [43] Drake was often bullied in school for his racial and religious
      background,
      [35] and upon realizing that his busy class schedule was detrimental to his burgeoning acting career, Drake
      dropped out of school.
      [51] He later graduated in October 2012.
      [52]
      At 15, eager to begin as an actor, a high school friend introduced Drake to his father, who was an acting agent.
      [53] The agent
      found Drake a role on Canadian teen drama series Degrassi: The Next Generation. Drake portrayed Jimmy Brooks,
      [54] a
      basketball star who became physically disabled after he was shot by a classmate. When asked about his early acting career,
      Drake replied, "My mother was very sick. We were very poor, like broke. The only money I had coming in was off of
      Canadian TV".
      [43] He would continue to appear on the show until 2007, retur
      After becoming musically inspired by Jay Z and Clipse, Drake self-released his debut
      mixtape, Room for Improvement, in 2006. The mixtape featured Trey Songz and
      Lupe Fiasco, and included vast production from Canadian producers Boi-1da, and
      Frank Dukes. When asked about the mixtape, Drake described the project as "pretty
      straightforward, radio friendly, [and] not much content to it." The mixtape was
      released for sale only, and confirmed to have sold over 6,000 copies.
      [54] In 2007, he
      released his second mixtape, Comeback Season. Released from his recently founded
      October's Very Own label, it spawned the single "Replacement Girl", featuring Trey
      Songz. The song made Drake become the first ever unsigned Canadian rapper to
      have his music video featured on BET, with "Replacement Girl" being featured on
      the channel's "New Joint of the Day" segment on April 30, 2007.
      [57] The song also
      saw Drake sample "Man of the Year" by Brisco, Flo Rida and Lil Wayne, retaining Lil
      Wayne's verse, and adjoined his own to the song's earlier half. This caused Jas
      Prince to gift Lil Wayne the song, which prompted the rapper to invite Drake to
      Houston in order to join his Tha Carter III tour. Throughout the duration of the
      tour, Drake and Lil Wayne recorded multiple songs together, including "Ransom", "I
      Want This Forever", and a remix to "Brand New". Despite the collaborations
      between the duo, Drake was yet to be signed by Young Money Entertainment.
      In 2009, Drake released his third mixtape, So Far Gone. It was made available for free download through his OVO blog
      website, and featured Lil Wayne, Trey Songz, Omarion, Lloyd, and Bun B. It received over 2,000 downloads in the first 2
      hours of release, finding mainstream commercial success due to the singles "Best I Ever Had" and "Successful", both
      gaining Gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with the former also peaking at
      number two on the Billboard Hot 100.
      [58] This prompted the mixtape's re-release as an EP, featuring only four songs from
      the original, as well as the additions of the songs "I'm Goin' In" and "Fear". It debuted at number six on the Billboard 200,
      and won the Rap Recording of the Year at the 2010 Juno Awards.
      [59]
      Due to the success of the mixtape,
      [60] Drake was the subject of a bidding war from various labels, often reported as "one of
      the biggest bidding wars ever".
      [61] Despite this, Drake was rumoured to have secured a recording contract with Young
      Money Entertainment on June 29, 2009.
      [62] This was later confirmed following a planned lawsuit from Young Money, in
      conjunction with Drake, against an unauthorized album entitled The Girls Love Drake, which was released on iTunes
      under dubious means.
      [63]
      Drake then joined the rest of the label's roster the America's Most Wanted Tour in July 2009. However, during a
      performance of "Best I Ever Had" in Camden, New Jersey, Drake fell on stage, and tore the anterior cruciate ligament in
      his right knee.
      [64]
      Drake planned to release his debut album, Thank Me Later, in late 2008, but the album's release date was postponed, first
      to March 2010,
      [65] and then to May 25, 2010.
      [66] Young Money and Universal Motown had then released a statement that
      the album had again been pushed back three weeks, for a June 15, 2010, release.
      [65][67]
      On March 9, 2010, Drake released the debut single "Over",
      [68] peaking at number fourteen on the Billboard Hot 100, as
      well as topping the Rap Songs chart. It also received a nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 53rd Grammy
      Awards.
      [69] His second single, "Find Your Love", became an even bigger success; peaking at number five on the Hot 100,
      and was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).
      [70] The music video for the single
      was shot in Kingston, Jamaica, and was criticized by Jamaica's minister of tourism, Edmund Bartlett. Bartlett condemned
      Lil Wayne, the founder of Young
      Money Entertainment, would
      sign Drake to the label in
      2009.
      [56]
      2010–2011: Thank Me Later
      the portrayal of the island in the video, saying, "care has to be taken by all, including our creative artists, in [showcasing]
      images of our destination and people. Gun culture, while not unique to Jamaica, is not enhancing [the island's image]."
      [71]
      The third single and fourth singles, "Miss Me" and "Fancy" respectively,
      [72] attained moderate commercial success,
      however, the latter garnered Drake his second nomination at the 53rd Grammy Awards, for Best Rap Performance by a
      Duo or Group.
      [73] On April 29, it was reportedly announced that Drake had finished Thank Me Later during a show in
      Kansas City, Missouri.
      [74]
      Thank Me Later was released on June 15, 2010,
      [75] debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with sales of over
      447,000 copies in its first week.
      [76] Upon the album's release, 25,000 fans gathered at New York City's South Street
      Seaport for a free concert, hosted by Drake and Hanson, which was later cancelled by police after a near-riot ensued due to
      overflowing crowds.
      [77] The album became the top selling debut album for any artist in 2010,
      [78] and featured Lil Wayne,
      Kanye West,
      [79] and Jay Z.
      [80]
      It was soon announced that Drake would have a prominent role in military science fiction video game, Gears of War 3. He
      was scheduled to play the part of Jace Stratton, but scheduling conflicts with his upcoming Away from Home Tour
      [81]
      prevented Drake from accepting the role.
      [82] He began the tour on September 20, 2010, in Miami, Florida, performing at
      78 shows over four different legs.
      [83] It concluded in Las Vegas in November 2010.
      [84] Due to the success of the Away from
      Home Tour, Drake hosted the first OVO Festival in 2010. It would soon become a regular event during the summer, with
      the Molson Amphitheatre in Toronto playing host to the festival on its annual cycle. Drake also had an eco-friendly college
      tour to support the album, beginning with Eastern Illinois University in Charleston, Illinois. It concluded in Plymouth,
      New Hampshire on May 8, and he had also performed at The Bamboozle on May 1.
      [85][86]
      Beginning his second effort in fall 2010,
      [87] Drake announced his intentions to allow for Noah "40" Shebib to handle most
      of the production and record a more cohesive sound than on Thank Me Later, which featured disparate production duties
      by Shebib and others.
      [88] In November 2010, Drake revealed the title of his next studio album will be Take Care.
      [89] In
      comparison to his debut album, Drake revealed to Y.C Radio 1 that Thank Me Later was a rushed album, stating, "I didn't
      get to take the time that I wanted to on that record. I rushed a lot of the songs and sonically I didn't get to sit with the
      record and say, 'I should change this verse.' Once it was done, it was done. That's why my new album is called Take Care,
      because I get to take my time this go-round."
      [90] Drake sought to expand on the low-tempo, sensuous, and dark sonic
      esthetic of Thank Me Later.
      [91][92] Primarily a hip hop album, Drake attempted to incorporate R&B and pop to create a
      languid, grandiose sound.
      [93]
      In January 2011, Drake was in negotiations to join Eva Green and Susan Sarandon as a member of the cast in Nicholas
      Jarecki's Arbitrage,
      [94] before ultimately deciding against starring in the movie, to focus on the album. "Dreams Money
      Can Buy"
      [95] and "Marvins Room"
      [91] were released on Drake's October's Very Own Blog, on May 20 and June 9,
      respectively. Acting as promotional singles for Take Care, the former was eventually unincluded on the album's final track
      listing, while "Marvins Room" gained Gold certification by the RIAA,
      [96] as well as peaking at number 21 on the Billboard
      Hot 100,
      [97] and reaching the top 10 of the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart,
      [98] coupled with extensive play on
      contemporary urban radio.
      [99] Drake would soon release the song's music video on June 28.
      [100]
      "Headlines" was released on August 9, acting as the lead single for Take Care. It was met with positive critical and
      commercial response, reaching number thirteen on the Hot 100, as well as becoming his tenth single to reach the summit
      of the Billboard Hot Rap Songs, making Drake the artist with the most number-one singles on the chart, with 12.
      [101] It
      was eventually certified Platinum in both the United States and Canada.
      [102] The music video for the single was released on
      October 2, and foresaw Drake performing the song during the second intermission of the 59th National Hockey League
      All-Star Game in January 2012.
      [103] "Make Me Proud" was released as the album's second single, on October 16.
      [104] It was
      2011–2012: Take Care
      the final single to be released prior to the launch of the album, and debuted at
      number 97 on the Billboard Hot 100.
      [97] The song reached number nine the
      following week, tying the record for the largest jump on the Billboard Hot 100 for a
      male artist, with 88.
      [105] "Make Me Proud" soon became Drake's fourth consecutive
      single to receive Platinum certification by the RIAA.
      [106]
      Drake had also planned to record a collaborative album with Lil Wayne, however,
      it was ultimately scrapped due to the success of Watch the Throne.
      [107][108][109]
      Drake had also begun collaborations with Rick Ross for a mixtape entitled
      Y.O.L.O., but was decided against in favour of increased concern for their
      respective studio albums.
      [110][111]
      Take Care was released on November 15, 2011, and received generally positive
      reviews from music critics.
      [8] John McDonnell of NME dubbed it "an affecting
      masterpiece" and commended its "delicate, mellifluous sound and unashamedly
      candid, emotive lyrics."
      [112] Pitchfork's Ryan Dombal found Drake's "technical
      abilities" to be improved and stated, "Just as his thematic concerns have become
      richer, so has the music backing them up."
      [113] Andy Hutchins of The Village Voice
      called it "a carefully crafted bundle of contradictory sentiments from a conflicted rapper who explores his own neuroses in
      as compelling a manner as anyone not named Kanye West."
      [114] Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot complimented the depth
      of Drake's "moral psychodramas" and stated, "the best of it affirms that Drake is shaping a pop persona with staying
      power."
      [115] It was also certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA in 2016, with sales for the album marking 2.6 million in
      the US,
      [116] as well as winning the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards.
      The album's third and fourth singles, "The Motto" and Take Care", were released on November 29,
      [96] and February 21,
      2012 respectively.
      [117] Each song was subject to commercial success, while also having large societal impacts, with "The
      Motto" credited for popularizing the phrase "YOLO" in the United States.
      [118][119] The music video for "Take Care" saw
      widespread acclaim, with MTV stating, "None of his contemporaries – not even the ever-obtuse Kanye [West] - make
      videos like this, mostly because no one else can get away with it."
      [120] The video received four nominations at the 2012
      MTV Video Music Awards, for Best Male Video, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Video of the Year.
      [121] The
      song was also featured on the channel's "Pop Songs You Must Hear" list of 2011.
      [122] "HYFR" was the final single to be
      released from the album, and became certified Gold.
      [123][124] It would later win the MTV Video Music Award for Best HipHop
      Video in 2012.
      [125][126] Drake was soon ranked at number two on MTV's "Hottest MCs in the Game" list in 2011.
      [127]
      In promotion of his second album, Drake embarked on the worldwide Club Paradise Tour. It became the most successful
      hip hop tour of 2012, grossing over $42 million.
      [128] Drake would also star in Ice Age: Continental Drift, providing the
      voice for Ethan.
      [129]
      During the European leg of the Club Paradise Tour, Drake spoke in an interview stating that he had begun working on his
      third studio album. Revealing his intentions to remain with 40 as the album's executive producer, Drake spoke fondly
      about Jamie xx, hoping to include and expand the British producer's influence over his next album.
      [130] Drake had also
      revealed that the album would stylistically differ from Take Care, departing from the ambient production and despondent
      lyrics prevalent previously.

      from January 2015
      In January 2013, Drake announced that he would release the first single off of his third album at the conclusion of the 55th
      Annual Grammy Awards.
      [132][133] Despite an initial delay, it was released in the wake of his win for the Grammy Award for
      Best Rap Album at the event, and it foresaw Drake announcing Nothing Was the Same as the title of his third album.
      [134]
      The album's second single, "Hold On, We're Going Home", was released in August 2013, becoming the most successful
      single off of the album, peaking at number-one on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.
      [135] Drake sought
      inspiration from the 1980s television series Miami Vice during the composition of the song's music video, incorporating
      the dramatic elements seen in the show en route to winning his second MTV Video Music Award in 2014 for the
      video.
      [136][137][138] Drake appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, performing the album's third single, "Too Much",
      alongside featured artist Sampha.
      [139]
      Nothing Was the Same was released on September 24, 2013, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200, with
      658,000 copies sold in its first week of release. The album debuted atop the charts in Canada, Denmark, Australia and the
      United Kingdom. The album also enjoyed generally favourable reviews by contemporary music critics, commending the
      musical shift in terms of the tone and subject matter, comparing it to the distinct change showcased in 808s &
      Heartbreak.
      [140] The album was also reported to have sold over 1,720,000 copies in the United States, and was further
      promoted by the "Would You like a Tour?" throughout late 2013, to early 2014.
      [141] It became the 22nd-most successful
      tour of the year, grossing an estimated $46 million.
      [142] Drake returned to acting in January 2014, hosting Saturday Night
      Live, as well as serving as the musical guest. His versatility, acting ability and comedic timing were all praised by critics,
      describing it as what "kept him afloat during the tough and murky SNL waters".
      [143][144][145] Drake also performed in
      Dubai, being one of the only artists ever to perform in the city.
      [146] In late 2014, Drake announced that he had begun
      recording sessions for his fourth studio album.
      [147]
      On February 12, 2015, Drake released If You're Reading This It's Too Late onto iTunes, with no prior announcement.
      Despite debate on whether it is an album[148] or a mixtape,
      [149]
      its commercial stance quantifies it as his fourth retail
      project with Cash Money Records.
      [150][151] If You're Reading This It's Too Late sold over 1 million units in 2015, making
      Drake the first artist with a platinum project in 2015, as well as his fourth overall.
      [152] Drake proceeded If You're Reading
      This It's Too Late with a collaborative mixtape with Future,
      [153][154] which was recorded in Atlanta in just under a week.
      [155]
      What a Time to Be Alive debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, making
      Drake the first hip hop artist to have two projects reach number one in the
      same year since 2004.
      [156] It was later certified platinum by the Recording
      Industry Association of America (RIAA), for combined sales, streaming and
      track-sales equivalent of over 1 million units.
      [157] Drake also appeared on the
      cover of The Fader for their 100th issue.
      [158]
      Drake announced in January 2016 that his fourth studio album would be
      launched during the spring, releasing the promotional single "Summer Sixteen" later that month. The album was originally
      titled Views from the 6, but would later be shortened to Views.
      [159] "Summer Sixteen" debuted at number six on the US
      Billboard Hot 100, and proved controversial, with Drake comparing his standing in hip hop to more tenured artists. This
      move divided many contemporary music critics, describing his self-comparison as "goodly brash" or "conventionally
      disrespectful."
      [160][161][162] It was also interpreted as a diss track towards Tory Lanez, who was unhappy at Drake
      popularizing the term "The Six" when referencing Toronto.
      [163][164] Drake also crashed a Bat Mitzvah in New York City on
      February 20, performing at the event.
      [165]
      2016–2018: Views and More Life
      Drake soon released the album's lead singles, "Pop Style" and the dancehall-infused "One Dance", on April 5. Both debuted
      within the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100,
      [166] however, the latter proved more commercially successful, with "One
      Dance" becoming Drake's first number-one single in Canada and the US as a leading artist.
      [167][168] The single also became
      Drake's first number one single as a lead artist in the United Kingdom, and peaked at number one in Germany, France,
      Australia, Brazil, Sweden, Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands.
      [169][170] During an episode for OVO Sound Radio, Drake
      confirmed the album's release date of April 29, through a tweet and various promotional videos.
      [171] On October 15, "One
      Dance" became Spotify's most-streamed song ever, amassing over 882 million plays as of October 2016.
      [172]
      Views was previewed in London, before its premiere on Beats 1 a day later. It
      was released as an Apple Music and iTunes exclusive on April 29, before being
      made available to various other platforms later that week.
      [173][174] Views would
      become Drake's most commercially successful album, sitting atop the Billboard
      200 for ten nonconsecutive weeks, as well as simultaneously leading the
      Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 for eight weeks. It also achieved
      double-platinum status in the US, and earned over 1 million album-equivalent
      units in the first week of its release, as well as gaining over half-billion overall
      streams of the album.
      [13][14][175] Despite its success, critical opinion towards the
      album remained much divided, drawing criticism for being overlong and
      lacking in a cohesive theme, while also claiming Drake was not challenging
      himself artistically, as opposed to his contemporaries.
      [176] He would later plan
      to release a short film entitled Please Forgive Me.
      [177]
      Drake returned to host Saturday Night Live on May 14, serving as the show's musical guest.
      [178] Later, Drake was named
      as a member of the Forbes Five, which ranks the wealthiest artists in hip-hop, placing fifth after Birdman, Jay Z, Dr. Dre,
      and Diddy respectively.
      [179] Drake and Future then announced the Summer Sixteen Tour to showcase their collective
      mixtape, as well as their respective studio albums. This marked Drake's third co-headlining tour, which began in Austin,
      Texas on July 20.
      [180][181][182] On July 23, Drake announced that he was working on a new project, scheduled to be released
      in early 2017,
      [183] and was later named as the headline act for the 2016 iHeartRadio Music Festival.
      [184] The latter dates of
      the Summer Sixteen Tour were postponed, however, due to Drake suffering an ankle injury.
      [185] During the 2016 OVO
      Festival, Kanye West confirmed that he and Drake had begun working on a collaborative album.
      [186] Soon after, the music
      video for "Child's Play" was released, depicting Drake and Tyra Banks playing a couple encountering relationship issues at
      the Cheesecake Factory in a reference to one of the song's lyrics.
      [187] On September 26, Please Forgive Me was released as
      an Apple Music exclusive. It ran a total of 25 minutes, and featured music from Views.
      [188] At the 2016 BET Hip-Hop
      Awards, Drake received the most nominations, with 10,
      [189] winning the awards for Album of the Year and Best Hip-Hop
      Video.
      [190][191] Drake later announced the Boy Meets World Tour on October 10, with twenty-six dates announced for the
      course of the tour in Europe.
      [192] Seven additional dates were added a day later due to overwhelming demand.
      [193] Soon
      after, during an episode of OVO Sound Radio, Drake confirmed he would be releasing a project entitled More Life in
      December, however he later pushed the date back to the new year. The project was described as a "playlist of original
      music", rather than being classified as a traditional mixtape or solo album.
      [194] He was later revealed to be Spotify's most
      streamed artist for the second consecutive year in 2016, amassing a total 4.7 billion streams for all projects on the service,
      which is more than double the amount of streams he had in 2015.
      [195] Drake later secured his second and third Grammy
      Awards, winning for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song at the 59th ceremony.
      [15] Despite multiple setbacks,
      Drake announced More Life would be released on March 18, 2017, via a series of multiple video commercials released
      through Instagram.
      [196] Upon release, More Life received mostly positive reviews, and debuted atop the Billboard 200,
      earning 505,000 album-equivalent units in its first week.
      [197] It also set a streaming record, becoming the highest ever
      streamed album in 24 hours, with a total of 89.9 million streams on Apple Music alone. The album also garnered
      61.3 million streams on Spotify, dethroning Ed Sheeran's ÷ as the highest opening on the service in a single day.
      [198] He
      Drake performing at the Summer
      Sixteen Tour in Toronto in 2016.
      later won 13 awards at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards in May, which saw him breaking the record for the most wins in a
      single show.
      [199] Billboard also reported Drake had been present on the Hot 100 chart for eight consecutive years, and has
      the most recorded entries by a solo artist.
      [200]
      He then released the single "Signs" on June 24, as well as reuniting with Metro Boomin on a single with Offset.
      [201][202] The
      singles marked his first releases since More Life, with "Signs" was initially released as a collaboration between Drake and
      French fashion house Louis Vuitton, as part of the "Louis Vuitton Men’s Spring-Summer 2018" fashion show.
      [203] The
      event also had a playlist exclusively from OVO Sound, curated by label co-founder Oliver El-Khatib.
      [204] Drake later hosted
      the first annual NBA Awards on June 26, and starred in multiple commercials alongside his father in promotion of
      Virginia Black.
      [205][206] Drake then appeared in The Carter Ef ect documentary, honouring the basketball career of Vince
      Carter, who was the first superstar player to appear for the Toronto Raptors since the franchise's inception in 1995.
      [207] The
      documentary also featured NBA players Chris Bosh, Tracy McGrady, Steve Nash, and LeBron James.
      After rumours circulated of Drake possibly collaborating with various artists, including rapper Trippie Redd and producer
      Pi'erre Bourne, for his new studio album, multiple snippets of songs were leaked near the closing end of 2017.
      [208][209][210]
      Two songs would later be released as members of a mini EP, titled Scary Hours, on January 20, 2018, marking Drake's
      first solo release since More Life, as well as his first appearance on any song after featuring on a remix of the Jay-Z song
      "Family Feud" with Lil Wayne, as the lead single of the latter's Dedication 6: Reloaded mixtape.
      [211] Scary Hours also
      featured the top-ten singles "Diplomatic Immunity" and "God's Plan", with the latter breaking various streaming records
      as it debuted at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100.
      [212][213][214] The song was Drake's second as a solo artist to reach
      number one.
      Drake earned his 70th top 40 hit after the Migos song "Walk It Talk It" featuring Drake debuted at number eighteen, and
      later number ten.
      [215] He also featured on Memphis rapper BlocBoy JB's debut single, "Look Alive", which was released on
      February 9, 2018.
      [216] The song's entry at number six on the Hot 100 made Drake the rapper with the most top 10 hits on
      the Hot 100, with 23.
      [217] He later featured on a remix to "Lemon", a song originally released as a collaboration between
      band N.E.R.D and Rihanna. On April 5, 2018, Drake announced he was finishing his fifth studio album and he was
      releasing a single later that night.
      [218] On April 6, "Nice for What" was released, alongside a music video that featured
      notable female celebrities Tracee Ellis Ross and Rashida Jones, among others.
      [219][220] After "Nice For What" replaced his
      own "God's Plan" on the Billboard Hot 100 at number one, making him the first artist to have a new number-one debut
      replace their former number-one debut, Drake announced the title of his fifth studio album as Scorpion, with a planned
      release date of June 29, 2018.
      [221][222] He then released "I'm Upset" on May 26, which was the album's third single.
      [223]
      Scorpion was then released as a double-album, and marked Drake's longest project, with a run-time of just under 90
      minutes. On its first day of release, it broke both the one-day global records on Spotify and Apple Music, as it gained
      132.45 million and 170 million plays on each streaming service, respectively.
      [224]
      Drake has cited several hip hop artists as influencing his rapping style, including Kanye West,
      [225] Jay Z,
      [226] and Lil
      Wayne,
      [227] while also attributing various R&B artists as influential to the incorporation of the genre into his own music,
      including Aaliyah,
      [228] and Usher.
      [229] Drake has also credited several dancehall artists for later influencing his Caribbeaninflected
      style, including Vybz Kartel, whom he has called one of his "biggest inspirations".
      [230][231]
      2018–present: Scary Hours and Scorpion
      Artistry
      Inuences
      Drake is known for his egotistical lyrics, technical ability, and integration
      of personal backstory when dealing with relationships with women.
      [232]
      His vocal abilities have been lauded for an audible contrast between
      typical hip-hop beats and melody, with sometimes abrasive rapping
      coupled with softer accents, delivered on technical lyricism.
      [233] His songs
      often include audible changes in lyrical pronunciation in parallel with his
      upbringing in Toronto, and connections with Caribbean and Middle
      Eastern countries which include such phrases as "ting", "touching road",
      "talkin' boasy" and "gwanin' wassy".
      [233] Most of his songs contain R&B
      and Canadian hip hop elements, and he combines rapping with
      singing.
      [234] He credits his father with the introduction of singing into his
      rap mixtapes, which have become a staple in his musical repertoire. His
      incorporation of melody into technically complex lyrics was supported by
      Lil Wayne, and has subsequently been a critically acclaimed component
      to Drake's singles and albums.
      [235] His rapping ability has been noted as "polarizing", and has contributed to him being
      named one of the most divisive rappers of his generation by multiple critics and media publications.
      [236]
      The lyrical content that Drake deploys is typically considered to be emotional
      [237] or boastful.
      [238] However, Drake is often
      revered for incorporating "degrading" themes of money, drug use, and women into newer, idealized contexts, often
      achieving this through his augmentation of the typical meaning of phrases in which he combines an objective and
      subjective perspective into one vocal delivery. His songs often maintain tension between "pause and pace, tone timbre, and
      volume and vocal fermata."
      [239] Drake is credited with innovating what has been referred to as "hyper-reality rap", which is
      characterized by its focus on themes of celebrity as being distinct from the "real world."
      [240]
      The Washington Post editor Maura Judkis credits Drake for popularizing the phrase "YOLO" in the United States, with his
      single, "The Motto", which includes, "You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO."
      [241] Drake later popularized the
      term "The Six" in 2015 in relation his hometown Toronto, subsequently becoming a point of reference to the city.
      [242]
      Furthermore, the subject matter of his artistry often revolving around relationships, have had widespread impact on social
      media through photo captions commonly used to reference emotions or personal situations.
      [243][244][245] However, his
      lyrical contents have had a negative reception from fans and critics deeming him as sensitive; a trait that is understood as
      being antithetical to hip hop culture.
      [246] June 10 was declared "Drake Day" in Houston, Texas.
      [247][248][249] In 2016, Drake
      visited Drake University after a show in Des Moines, in response to an extensive social media campaign by students that
      began in 2009, advocating for his appearance.
      [250][251] In 2016, Drake spoke on the shooting of Alton Sterling, publishing
      an open letter expressing his concern for the safety of ethnic minorities against police brutality in the United States.
      [252] He
      would also donate $200,000 in order to aid relief efforts in Houston as a result of Hurricane Harvey.
      [253] In February
      2018, following the single "God's Plan" debut at no. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, Drake donated $50,000 to a Miami
      homeless shelter
      [254] and giving a University of Miami student $50,000 to help with her tuition.
      [255] Drake then "kept up
      the spending spree" by donating the rest of the song's video budget, $996,631.90, to several charitable causes and regular
      people across Miami.[256][257]
      The music video for "Hotline Bling" went viral, due to Drake's eccentric choices in dancing.
      [258] The video has been
      remixed, memed, and was heavily commented on due to Drake's unconventional nature on the song,
      [259] causing it to gain
      popularity on YouTube, spawning several parodies.
      [260] Drake has also been critiqued for his expensive, product
      placement-heavy attire, exampled by the video for "Hotline Bling". Drake modelled a $1,500 Moncler Puffer Jacket, a
      Musical style
      Drake has credited Kanye West (left) and
      Aaliyah (right) as being his biggest musical
      inuences.
      Public image
      $400 Acne Studios turtleneck, and limited edition Timberland 6" Classic Boots.
      [261][262] This foresaw collaborations
      between OVO and Canada Goose,
      [263]
      in which various items of clothing were produced.
      [264] Drake had also released his
      own collection of Air Jordans, dubbed the "Air Jordan OVOs".
      [265] Moreover, his style and dress sense have caused GQ
      magazine to describe him as "[one of] the most stylish men alive".
      [266]
      In 2012, singer Ericka Lee filed a lawsuit against Drake for the usage of her voice on "Marvins Room". Claiming to have
      provided the female vocals, Lee also alleged she was owed songwriting credits and royalties.
      [267] Despite Drake's legal team
      countering by claiming that Lee simply requested a credit in the liner notes of the album, the matter was resolved in
      February 2013, with both parties agreeing to an out-of-court settlement.
      [268] In 2014, Drake was sued for $300,000 for
      sampling "Jimmy Smith Rap", a 1982 single by jazz musician, Jimmy Smith. The suit was filed by Smith's estate, who
      stated Drake never asked for permission when sampling it for the intro on "Pound Cake / Paris Morton Music 2", claiming
      Smith himself would have disagreed as he disliked hip hop.
      [269][270] Drake would win the lawsuit in 2017, with federal judge
      William Pauley ruling the content used was transformative, and there was no liability for copyright infringement.
      [271] Also
      in 2014, it emerged that Drake was sued by rapper Rappin' 4-Tay, claiming Drake misused his lyrics on when collaborating
      with YG on the song "Who Do You Love?". He sought $100,000 for mistreatment and artistic theft, which Drake paid to
      the rapper later that year.
      [272] In 2016, Drake caused a nightclub in Oklahoma City to close down, due to his usage of
      marijuana and other illegal drugs being prevalent at the club.
      [273]
      In 2017, Drake was embroiled in another lawsuit, being sued by producer Detail (Noel Fisher) over an alleged assault in
      2014. Fisher claimed Drake's bodyguard, Nessel "Chubbs" Beezer, punched him in the face and allegedly broke his jaw
      over musical and financial disputes. Fisher also says the injuries caused him to be hospitalized for days and had to undergo
      several surgeries, following which he sued for damages related to medical bills and physical and emotional suffering.
      [274]
      The case, which was set to undergo trial in May 2018, was eventually dismissed by Superior Court Judge Elaine Lu, after
      Fisher failed to show up for a final status conference, and ruled Beezer solely acted in self-defense.
      [275]
      Drake and Chris Brown were allegedly involved in a physical altercation in June 2012, when Drake and his entourage
      threw glass bottles at Brown in a SoHo nightclub in Manhattan, New York City. Chris Brown tweeted about the incident
      and released a song criticizing Drake weeks later.
      [276][277][278] Despite no response from Drake, he and Brown both
      appeared in a comedic skit for the 2014 ESPY Awards, and rehearsed the skit together prior to the televised airing,
      virtually ending the dispute.
      [279]
      In December 2014, Drake was involved in another altercation, being punched by Diddy outside the LIV nightclub in
      Miami, Florida. The altercation was reported to be over Drake's usage of the instrumental for "0 to 100 / The Catch Up",
      allegedly produced by Boi-1da for Diddy, before Drake appropriated the track for his own use. Drake was later rushed to
      the ER after aggravating an old arm injury during the dispute.
      [280] Drake was also involved in a feud with Tyga, stemming
      from Tyga's negative comments towards him during an interview with Vibe.
      [281] Drake would later respond on "6 God" and
      "6PM in New York", which has been interpreted as directly involved in Tyga's abrupt removal from Young Money
      Entertainment.
      [282]
      Controversies
      Legal issues
      Feuds
      Further controversy arose in July 2015, when it was alleged by Meek Mill that Drake had used ghostwriters during
      recording sessions for "RICO", one of the lead singles off of Mill's second studio album. This proceeded further allegations
      that Drake did not help in promotion of the album, due to Mill discovering the ghostwriter, widely believed to be Quentin
      Miller.
      [283] Despite Miller collaborating with Drake and receiving past credits, Mill assured that Miller had written Drake's
      verse for "R.I.C.O.". Soon after, Funkmaster Flex aired reference tracks in support of Mill's claims, notably for "R.I.C.O.",
      "10 Bands", and "Know Yourself". This prompted Drake to respond with two diss tracks, entitled "Charged Up"
      [284] and
      "Back to Back",
      [285]
      in the space of four days. Mill would later respond with "Wanna Know",
      [286] before removing it from
      SoundCloud weeks later.
      [287] Despite subliminal disses
      [288][289][290]
      from either artist,
      [291]
      the feud has not been officially
      reignited. Drake would further seek to denounce Funkmaster Flex during his Madison Square Garden shows on the
      Summer Sixteen Tour.
      [292][293] Following Meek Mill's sentencing of two to four years for probation violation, Drake stated
      "Free Meek Mill" at a concert in Australia, while also seeming to end their rivalry on "Family Feud".
      [294] Pusha T would
      also used the same rationale to criticize Drake in songs in 2018,
      [295] prompting Drake to respond with the "Duppy
      Freestyle" diss track on May 25.
      [296] Pusha T would directly respond to the track through "The Story of Adidon" on May 29,
      and presented several claims, including an accusation of Drake fathering a secret child.
      [297] The pair have been considered
      to have been in a rivalry since 2012, with Drake yet to respond to "The Story of Adidon".
      [298]
      In 2016, Drake was embroiled in a feud with Joe Budden, stemming from Budden's derogatory comments when reviewing
      Views. Drake would allegedly respond to Budden through "4PM in Calabasas", prompting Budden to respond with two
      diss tracks in the space of five days, echoing the same sentiment Drake deployed during his feud with Meek Mill. Drake
      would later appear on "No Shopping" alongside French Montana, directly referencing Budden throughout the song.
      However, French Montana claimed that Drake's verse was recorded before the release of Budden's diss tracks. Despite
      Budden releasing two further songs in reference to Drake,
      [299] he has yet to officially respond to Budden.
      [300] In the same
      year, Drake mocked Kid Cudi for his mental health, drug use and suicidal urges on "Two Birds, One Stone" after Cudi
      launched an expletive-filled rant on the artist on Twitter.
      [301] Cudi later checked into a rehabilitation facility following the
      release of the song, and continued to disparage Drake in further tweets.
      [302]
      Drake has purported to have been in reported feuds with DMX, Kendrick Lamar,
      [303] Common,
      [304] The Weeknd,
      [305]
      XXXTentacion, Jay Z, Tory Lanez,
      [306] and Ludacris,
      [307] although the latter three have been reported to be
      resolved.
      [308][309][310]
      Prior to venturing into business, Drake garnered several endorsement deals with various companies, notably gaining one
      with Sprite following his mention of drinking purple drank, a concoction that contains Sprite as a key ingredient.
      [311][312]
      In the aftermath of his highly publicized feud with Meek Mill, Drake was also endorsed by fast food restaurants Burger
      King and Whataburger.
      [313] Business magazine Forbes commented his endorsement deals and business partnerships
      "combined heavily" for Drake's reported pre-tax earnings at $94 million between June 2016 to June 2017, being one of the
      highest-paid celebrities during that period.
      [314]
      During the composition of Nothing Was the Same, Drake started his own record label in late 2012 with producer Noah
      "40" Shebib, and business partner, Oliver El-Khatib. Drake sought for an avenue to release his own music, as well helping
      in the nurturing of other artists, while Shebib and El-Khatib yearned to start a label with a distinct sound, prompting the

      trio to team up to form OVO Sound.
      [315] The name is an abbreviation derived from the
      October's Very Own moniker Drake used to publish his earlier projects. The label is
      currently distributed by Warner Bros. Records.
      Drake, 40 and PartyNextDoor were the label's inaugural artists. The label houses artists
      including Drake, PartyNextDoor, Majid Jordan, OB O'Brien, Roy Woods, dvsn, Plaza,
      and Kash Doll,
      [316] as well as producers including 40, Boi-1da, T-Minus, Mike Zombie,
      Nineteen85, and Future the Prince. OVO Sound has released six albums, with two
      certified platinum or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).
      On September 30, 2013, Drake was announced as the new "global ambassador" for the Toronto Raptors, thereby joining
      the executive committee of the NBA franchise, in conjunction with the announcement of the 2016 NBA All-Star Game
      being awarded to the Air Canada Centre in Toronto.
      [317][318][319] This would also be the setting where Drake was given The
      Key to the City.
      [320] In the role, it was announced that Drake would help to promote and serve as a host of festivities,
      beginning with the All-Star Game. He would also provide consulting services to rebrand the team, helping to redesign its
      image and clothing line in commemoration of the franchise's 20th anniversary.
      [321][322] When attending the press
      conference hosted by Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment CEO, Tim Leiweke,
      [322]
      to formally announce Drake's hiring by
      the franchise, Drake stated, "obviously, I won't be able to be in the building every day but I am extremely dedicated to it. I
      do take it very seriously as a new job and a new chapter in my life."
      [323][324] He began by hosting an annual "Drake Night"
      segment with the organization, which began in 2013.
      [325]
      Following the launch of Apple Music, a music and video streaming service developed by Apple Inc., the company
      announced Drake as the figurehead for the platform at their Worldwide Developers Conference in 2015, with the artist also
      penning an exclusivity deal with the service worth a reported $19 million.
      [326] This saw all future solo releases by Drake
      becoming available first on Apple Music, before seeing roll out to other streaming services and music retailers.
      [327] Drake
      had also developed the OVO Sound Radio station on Beats 1, which is utilized as the primary avenue for debuting singles
      and projects, with the station overseeing over 300 million unique users when it debuted More Life.
      [328] Drake's
      partnership with Apple Music has largely been credited for the platform's sharp success, as it attained 10 million
      subscribers after six months, as well as giving birth to exclusivity from artists, with many independent and signed artists,
      such as Frank Ocean and The Weeknd, also brokering exclusivity deals with streaming services.
      [329] Through signing with
      the company, Drake was one of the artists, alongside Pharrell and Katy Perry, to exclusively own an Apple Watch before
      the smartwatch saw public release.
      [330]
      Two months prior to the release of Views, Drake announced the development of Virginia Black, a bourbon-based
      whiskey.
      [331] This would be his second foray into selling foodstuffs, previously partnering with celebrity chef Susur Lee to
      open Fring's Restaurant in Toronto.
      [332] The beverage was created and also distributed alongside Proximo Spirits, as well
      as with Brent Hocking, a spirits producer who founded DeLeón Tequila in 2008.
      [333] The company described the
      partnership as "fruitful [as they] share a passion for style, music, and the pursuit of taste [on] a quest to redefine
      whiskey."

      The product was launched in June 2016, and contained two, three and four-year old Bourbon whiskies. The company sold
      over 4,000 bottles in the first week domestically.
      [335] The brand was also promoted and marketed through Drake's music
      and various tours, such as being part of the "Virginia Black VIP Lounge" additional package available for purchase during
      the Summer Sixteen Tour. Virginia Black shipped a further 30,000 units when rollout was extended to select international
      markets in late 2016.
      [336] The company later aired commercials with Dennis Graham which featured the tagline of "The
      Realest Dude Ever" (in reference toward "The Most Interesting Man in the World" tagline employed by Dos Equis) after
      extending the sale of the drink to various European countries in 2017.
      [206]
      Drake has lived in Hidden Hills, California since 2012.
      [337][338][339][340]
      Drake's paternal uncles are bass guitarist Larry Graham and songwriter Teenie Hodges.
      [341][342] Graham was a member of
      the band Sly and the Family Stone.
      [343] Hodges featured as the lead guitarist and songwriter for Al Green, and contributed
      heavily on much of his work in the 1970s, including the hits "Take Me to the River", "Love and Happiness", and "Here I Am
      (Come and Take Me)".
      [344][345]
      Drake is a father to son Adonis, who was born on October 11, 2017,
      [346][347]
      to French artist and former adult actress
      [348][349]
      Sophie Brussaux.
      [350][351] Brussaux's pregnancy was the subject of several rumors, after featuring in a TMZ article in early
      2017,
      [352] before Adonis was mentioned by name during Drake's feud with Pusha T.
      [353] Drake confirmed his fatherhood on
      the album Scorpion in 2018.
