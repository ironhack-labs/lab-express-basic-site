        <h3>ABOUT DADA</h3>
        <p id="aboutpar">
            Dadaism was an art movement of the European avant-garde in the early 20th century, with early centres in Zürich, Switzerland, at the Cabaret Voltaire (circa 1916).
            New York Dada began circa 1915, and after 1920 Dada flourished in Paris. Developed in reaction to World War I, the Dada movement consisted of artists who rejected 
            the logic, reason, and aestheticism of modern capitalist society, instead expressing nonsense, irrationality, and anti-bourgeois protest in their works.
            The art of the movement spanned visual, literary, and sound media, including collage, sound poetry, cut-up writing, and sculpture. Dadaist artists expressed their 
            discontent toward violence, war, and nationalism. <br><br><br>
            <strong>THE NAME</strong><br><br>
            There is no consensus on the origin of the movement's name. A common story is that the German artist Richard Huelsenbeck 
            slid a paper knife (letter-opener) at random into a dictionary, where it landed on "dada", a colloquial French term for a hobby horse. Jean Arp wrote that Tristan Tzara 
            invented the word at 6 pm on 6 February 1916, in the Café de la Terrasse in Zurich.<br><br><br>
            <strong>THE HISTORY</strong><br><br>
            Dada emerged from a period of artistic and literary movements like Futurism, Cubism and Expressionism; centered mainly in Italy, France and Germany respectively, 
            in those years. However, unlike the earlier movements Dada was able to establish a broad base of support, giving rise to a movement that was international in scope. 
            Its adherents were based in cities all over the world including New York, Zürich, Berlin, Paris and others. There were regional differences like an emphasis on literature 
            in Zürich and political protest in Berlin.<br><br><br>
