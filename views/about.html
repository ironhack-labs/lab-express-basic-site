      <h1>Legacy</h1>
        <p>Albert Leornes Greene was born on April 13, 1946, in<br/> 
        Forrest City, Arkansas. The sixth of ten children born to<br/> 
        Cora Lee and Robert G. Greene, Jr., a sharecropper, Al began <br/>
        performing with his brothers in a group called the Greene Brothers at<br/> 
        around the age of ten. The Greene family relocated <br/>
        to Grand Rapids, Michigan, in the late 1950s.Al was kicked out of <br/>
        the family home while in his teens, after his devoutly religious father<br/> 
        caught him listening to Jackie Wilson.<br/>

        <em>"I also listened to Mahalia Jackson, all the great gospel singers.<br/> 
          But the most important music to me was those hip-shakinâ€™<br/> 
          boys: Wilson Pickett and Elvis Presley. I just loved Elvis Presley. <br/>
          Whatever he got, I went out and bought."</em><br/>
          
          In high school, Al formed a vocal group called Al Greene and the<br/>
          Creations. Two of the group's members, Curtis Rodgers and Palmer<br/> 
          James, formed an independent label called Hot Line Music<br/>
          Journal. In 1968, having changed their name to Al Greene and the<br/> 
          Soul Mates, they recorded the song "Back Up Train", releasing it<br/> 
          on Hot Line Music. The song was a hit on the R&amp;B charts. However,<br/> 
          the group's subsequent follow-ups failed to chart, as did their debut<br/> 
          album Back Up Train. While performing with the Soul Mates, Green<br/> 
          came into contact with Memphis record producer Willie Mitchell, who<br/> 
          hired him in 1969 to be a vocalist for a Texas show with Mitchell's<br/> 
          band. Following the performance, Mitchell asked Green to sign with<br/> 
          his Hi Records label.</p>
