        <h1>About Marilyn Monroe</h1>
        <h3>Who Was Marilyn Monroe?</h3>
        <p>
          Actress Marilyn Monroe overcame a difficult childhood to become one of
          the world's biggest and most enduring sex symbols. Her films grossed
          more than $200 million. She is known for her relationships with Arthur
          Miller, Joe DiMaggio and, possibly, President John F. Kennedy. Monroe
          died of a drug overdose on August 5, 1962, at only 36 years old.

        <h3>Early Life and Education</h3>
        <p>
          Monroe was born on June 1, 1926, in Los Angeles, California. Monroe
          was named Norma Jeane Mortenson at birth (later baptized as Norma
          Jeane Baker). Growing up, Monroe spent much of her time in foster care
          and in an orphanage. In 1937, a family friend and her husband, Grace
          and Doc Goddard, took care of Monroe for a few years. The Goddards
          were paid $25 weekly by Monroe's mother to raise her. The couple was
          deeply religious and followed fundamentalist doctrines; among other
          prohibited activities, Monroe was not allowed to go to the movies. But
          when Doc's job was transferred to the East Coast, the couple could not
          afford to bring Monroe with them. At seven years old, Monroe returned
          to a life in foster homes, where she endured sexual assault on several
          occasions; she later said that she had been raped when she was 11
          years old. She dropped out of high school by age 15. Monroe had a way
          out through marriage, and she wed her boyfriend and merchant marine
          Jimmy Dougherty in 1942, at the age of 16. Monroe never knew her
          father. She once thought Clark Gable to be her father â€” a story
          repeated often enough for a version of it to gain some currency.
          However, there's no evidence that Gable ever met or knew Monroe's
          mother, Gladys, who developed psychiatric problems and was eventually
          placed in a mental institution. As an adult, Monroe would maintain
          that one of her earliest memories was of her mother trying to smother
          her in her crib with a pillow. Monroe had a half-sister, to whom she
          was not close; they met only a half-dozen times.
