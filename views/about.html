        Magdalena Carmen Frida Kahlo y Calderón was a Mexican painter known for her many portraits, self-portraits, and
        works inspired by the nature and artifacts of Mexico. Inspired by the country's popular culture, she employed a
        naïve folk art style to explore questions of identity,
        postcolonialism, gender, class, and race in Mexican society. Her paintings often had strong autobiographical
        elements
        and mixed realism with fantasy. In addition to belonging to the post-revolutionary Mexicayotl movement, which
        sought to
        define a Mexican identity, Kahlo has been described as a surrealist or magical realist.
