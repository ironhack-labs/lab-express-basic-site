        <h3>Norris was born in Ryan, Oklahoma on March 10, 1940[3] to Wilma (n√©e Scarberry) and Ray
        Dee Norris, who was a World War II Army soldier,[4] a mechanic, bus driver, and truck driver.
        [5] Norris has stated that he has Irish and Cherokee roots.[4][6][7] Norris was named after
        Carlos Berry, his father's minister.[4] He was the oldest of three brothers, the younger two
        being Wieland and Aaron (a Hollywood producer). When Norris was sixteen, his parents divorced,
        [8] and he later relocated to Prairie Village, Kansas and then to Torrance, California with his
        mother and brothers.[6]
        Norris has described his childhood as downbeat. He was nonathletic, shy, and scholastically
        mediocre.[9] His father, Ray, worked intermittently as an automobile mechanic, and went on alcohol
        drinking binges that lasted for months at a time. Embarrassed by his father's behavior and the
        family's financial plight, Norris developed a debilitating introversion that lasted for his entire
        childhood.[10]</h3>
