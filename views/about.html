        Snyder’s work has appeared in forty languages and has received a number
        of prizes, including the Emerson Prize in the Humanities, the Literature
        Award of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the Václav Havel
        Foundation prize, the Foundation for Polish Science prize in the social
        sciences, the Leipzig Award for European Understanding, the Dutch
        Auschwitz Committee award, and the Hannah Arendt Prize in Political
        Thought. Snyder was a Marshall Scholar at Oxford, has received the
        Carnegie and Guggenheim fellowships, and holds state orders from
        Estonia, Lithuania, and Poland. He has appeared in documentaries, on
        network television, and in major films. His books have inspired poster
        campaigns and exhibitions, films, sculpture, a punk rock song, a rap
        song, a play, and an opera. His words are quoted in political
        demonstrations around the world, most recently in Hong Kong. He is
        researching a family history of nationalism and finishing a
        philosophical book about freedom.
