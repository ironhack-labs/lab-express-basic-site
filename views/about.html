                    Omar Devone Little is a fictional character on the HBO drama series The Wire, portrayed by Michael K. Williams. He is a notorious Baltimore stick-up man, who frequently robs street-level drug dealers. He is legendary around Baltimore for his characteristic duster, under which he hides his shotgun, large caliber handgun, and bulletproof vest, as well as for his facial scar and his whistling of "A-Hunting We Will Go"[1] when stalking targets. (Sometimes, the tune is characterized as "The Farmer in the Dell",[2] as in season 1, episode 5 - "The Pager", when he concludes with, "the cheese stands alone".[3][4]) When people see or hear him approaching, they run away and will often warn others by shouting "Omar comin'!" Omar has a strict moral code, which involves refusal to harm innocent "civilians" and distaste (usually) for profanity, setting him apart from other street-level characters. His homosexuality and privately tender nature starkly contrast with typical notions of machismo attached to violent criminals. Omar cares for his grandmother and is seen escorting her to church on Sunday mornings.[5] He also has a tendency to refer to himself in the third person.[6]

                    Omar steadily descends into intractable conflict with the Barksdale and Stanfield Organizations, initiated by his robberies. Omar is also noted for his close relationships with his partners, and with his guardian, ad hoc banker, and close friend Butchie.

                    Omar's character is based on the heterosexual Baltimore area robber and hitman Donnie Andrews.[7] In "Clarifications", it is stated that Omar is 34 years old. He was orphaned at a young age and raised by his grandmother Josephine, who was largely responsible for his strict moral code, despite his criminal occupation. (He tells her he works at a cafeteria, at the airport.[8]) He attended Edmondson High School in West Baltimore, a few years behind Bunk Moreland.

                    For more than ten years, Omar has made his living holding up drug dealers and staying alive "one day at a time". He repeatedly demonstrates exceptional skill at surveillance, and as a stick-up man and shooter, further contributing to his feared status as an efficient professional. Omar is highly intelligent and cunning, and consistently executes well-laid plans, anticipating his adversaries' moves and outsmarting them. He had a brother, "No Heart" Anthony, who was incarcerated for a jewellery store robbery in the early 1990s.
