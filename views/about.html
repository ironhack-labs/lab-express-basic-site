            <strong>Sia Kate Isobelle Furler</strong> (born 18 December 1975) is an Australian singer, songwriter, voice actress and director. 
            She started her career as a singer in the acid jazz band <strong>Crisp</strong> in the mid-1990s in Adelaide. 
            In 1997, when Crisp disbanded, she released her debut studio album, titled <strong>OnlySee</strong> , in Australia. 
            She moved to London and provided vocals for the British duo <strong>Zero 7</strong>. 
            Sia released her second studio album, <strong>Healing Is Difficult</strong>, in 2000, and her third studio album, <strong>Colour the Small One</strong>, in 2004.

            Sia relocated to New York City in 2005 and toured in the United States. 
            Her fourth and fifth studio albums, <strong>Some People Have Real Problems</strong> and <strong>We Are Born</strong>, were released in 2008 and 2010, respectively. 
            Each was certified gold by the <strong>Australian Recording Industry Association</strong> and attracted wider notice than her earlier albums. 
            Uncomfortable with her growing fame, Sia took a hiatus from performing, during which she focused on songwriting for other artists, producing successful collaborations <strong>"Titanium"</strong> (with David Guetta), <strong>"Diamonds"</strong> (with Rihanna) and <strong>"Wild Ones"</strong> (with Flo Rida).

            In 2014, Sia broke through as a solo recording artist when her sixth studio album, <strong>1000 Forms of Fear</strong>, debuted at No. 1 in the U.S. Billboard 200 and generated the top-ten single <strong>"Chandelier"</strong> and a trilogy of music videos co-directed by Sia and starring child dancer <strong>Maddie Ziegler</strong>. 
            Since then, Sia has usually worn a wig that obscures her face to protect her privacy. Her seventh studio album, <strong>This Is Acting</strong> (2016), spawned her first Billboard Hot 100 number one single, <strong>"Cheap Thrills"</strong>. 
            The same year, Sia began her <strong>Nostalgic for the Present Tour</strong>, which incorporated dancing by Ziegler and others and other performance art elements. 
            Her eighth studio album, <strong>Everyday Is Christmas</strong>, was released in 2017 and reissued in 2018 with three bonus tracks. 
            In 2018, she collaborated with <strong>Labrinth</strong> and <strong>Diplo</strong> in the group <strong>LSD</strong>, and they released their self-titled debut album in April 2019.

            Sia wrote and directed a feature film, titled <strong>Music</strong>, which was released in early 2021 alongside an album, <strong>Music â€“ Songs from and Inspired by the Motion Picture</strong>. 
            Among the accolades received by Sia are nearly a dozen <strong>ARIA Awards</strong>, <strong>9 Grammy Award</strong> nominations and an <strong>\MTV Video Music Award</strong>.
