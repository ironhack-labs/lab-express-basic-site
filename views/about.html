                <h1>THE CHEF</h1>
                <p>Born and raised in the Aveyron region of France, Cyril Lignac has always enjoyed the pleasure of a large table full of friends and family. Therefore it was only natural for Cyril to go to university to obtain his CAP for chocolate, ice cream, pastry and cooking. His passion drove him to Paris. Cyril evolved alongside three-star chef Alain Passard at Arpège and pastry chef Pierre Hermé.
                <br></br>
                In 2005, Cyril obtained his first post as Chef at La Suite and he began his television career with “Oui Chef!”. He also launched his first restaurant, Le Quinzième. It will be rewarded 7 years later with a star in the Michelin Guide and will close after 15 years of practice*.
                <br></br>
                In the meantime the Chef revealed his entrepreneurial skills. In 2008, he took over Le Chardenoux, an institution of Paris; in 2011 Cyril inaugurated Aux Prés, an emblematic Parisian bistro in place of Claude Sainlouis; before opening Le Bar des Prés in 2016 next door, with Asian influences; and in 2019, the Cocktail Bar Dragon.
                <br></br>
                He also began a sweet adventure with pastry Chef Benoît Couvrand. Together in 2011, they created La Pâtisserie, a local store where traditional and contemporary creations take pride of place; and in 2016 La Chocolaterie, a lively place dedicated entirely to cocoa. The duo is now overseeing 6 Parisian stores.
                <br></br>
                Cyril is always looking for opportunities to expand in the field of gourmet pleasures and to evolve his team. His entrepreneurial rigor and charm have enabled him to be elected ‘France’s favourite chef’.</p>
