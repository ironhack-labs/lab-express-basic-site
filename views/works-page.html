        <h1>Works of Nikola Tesla</h1>
        <h2>AC and the induction motor</h2>
        <p>In late 1886, Tesla met Alfred S. Brown, a Western 
            Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles F. Peck. 
            The two men were experienced in setting up companies and 
            promoting inventions and patents for financial gain. 
            Based on Tesla's new ideas for electrical equipment, 
            including a thermo-magnetic motor idea, 
            they agreed to back the inventor financially and handle 
            his patents. Together they formed the Tesla Electric Company 
            in April 1887, with an agreement that profits from generated 
            patents would go ⅓ to Tesla, ⅓ to Peck and Brown, and ⅓ to fund 
            development. They set up a laboratory for Tesla at 89 
            Liberty Street in Manhattan, where he worked on improving and 
            developing new types of electric motors, generators, and other 
            devices.</p>
