      <h2>Computing is too important to be left to men.</h2>
      <p class = "description" id = "people">Spärck Jones is responsible for the concept of inverse document frequency – a technology that underlies most modern search engines. She is also behind the use of thesauri into language processing, allowing for computational recognition of similar words. Her most notable achievements laid the groundwork for the sort of information retrieval we use today. And she also introduced the idea and methods of "term weighing" in information retrieval, which helped queries determine which terms were the most relevant.</p>
