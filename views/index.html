        <h1 class="title">Michael Cheval</h1>
        <p class="par">Michael Cheval is the world’s leading contemporary artist, specializing in Absurdist paintings, drawings and portraits. In his definition, “absurdity” is an inverted side or reality, a reverse side of logic. It does not emerge from the dreams of surrealists, or the work of subconsciousness. It is a game of imagination, where all ties are carefully chosen to construct a literary plot. Any one of Cheval’s paintings is a map of his journey into illusion. His work is often metaphorical and requires a sharp eye to decipher the often hidden allusions.</p>
