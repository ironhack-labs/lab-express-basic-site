          Suzana Herculano-Houzel is a Brazilian-born neuroscientist and associate professor at Vanderbilt University, where she studies what different brains are made of, what changes (or doesn't change) with different brain sizes, how much energy they cost, and what difference does all that make - especially in the context of how human brains compare to others. She has a TED talk on what makes the human brain special (if anything), and recently published a trade book, The Human Advantage, telling the back story to her research on human and elephant brains - and how cooking allowed us into existence.
