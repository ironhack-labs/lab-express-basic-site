            <h3>About dat boi</h3>

            <p>
                <b>Dat Boi</b> (coll: "that boy") is a nickname given to a 3D character model
                of a green frog riding a unicycle, typically accompanied by catchphrases like <em>"here comes dat boi!"</em>
                and <em>"o **** waddup!"</em> that went viral in early 2016
            </p>

            <p>
                Some claim that Dat Boi's origins can be found in an AP PHYSICS book as a problem's illustration,
                but it is uncertain if the meme came from the illustration or viceversa.
            </p>
            <p>
                As is evidenced in a viral Reddit <a
                    href="https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/605zdt/you_want_to_know_why_i_love_dat_boi/">copypasta</a>,
                some people believe Dat Boi to be the paragon of a "self made meme", claiming that: <em>The first person to
                ever upvote dat boi upvoted a meme literally pulled from the ether by sheer human creativity and
                willpower. Dat boi is evidence that humans can stare into the meaningless void of eternity and force
                their own meaning onto to it. I will always upvote dat boi, o **** waddup!"</em>
