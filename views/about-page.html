    <p>Anime is a diverse art form with distinctive production methods and <br>
      techniques that have been adapted over time in response to emergent <br>
      technologies. It consists of an ideal story-telling mechanism, combining <br>
      graphic art, characterization, cinematography, and other forms of <br>
      imaginative and individualistic techniques.[8] The production of <br>
      anime focuses less on the animation of movement and more on the <br>
      realism of settings as well as the use of camera effects, including <br>
      panning, zooming, and angle shots. Being hand-drawn, anime is <br>
      separated from reality by a crucial gap of fiction that provides <br>
      an ideal path for escapism that audiences can immerse themselves <br>
      into with relative ease.[8] Diverse art styles are used and <br>
      character proportions and features can be quite varied,<br>
      including characteristically large emotive or realistically <br>
      sized eyes.</p>
