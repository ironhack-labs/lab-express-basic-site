    <h1>Into the wild Book</h1>
    <p>
      Towards Wild Routes1 (in its original English version: Into The Wild) is a
      book written by Jon Krakauer in 1995, which in 2007 was adapted for film
      by director Sean Penn, under the original title of Into the Wild.
      Christopher McCandless, a young man from a wealthy family, in 1990 and
      after graduating from Emory University in Atlanta, decided to take a trip
      without telling anyone about his destination or what his intentions were.
      Two years later he would be found dead in the interior of Alaska. His case
      was made known through a report from Outside magazine by journalist Jon
      Krakauer. The latter, interested in the motivations and conditions that
      Chris endured, decided to investigate further into the history of this
      young man. Towards Wild Routes tells almost entirely of the events from
      the point of view of the last people Chris interacted with before entering
      the wild wilderness of Alaska, where he would eventually find his death.
      In addition, the author adds passages from his own life as a lover of
      nature and life in the mountains, referring to the small similarities he
      shares with Chris. At the same time, he tries to elucidate those key
      factors in the young man's life that led him to make the decision to enter
      that last route, completely distancing himself from his family and any
      indication of civilization.
