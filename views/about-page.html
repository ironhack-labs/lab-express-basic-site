        Sheeran's third album, ÷ (pronounced "divide"), was released in March 2017, and was the best-selling album
        worldwide of 2017. The first two singles from the album, "Shape of You" and "Castle on the Hill", broke records
        in a number of countries by debuting in the top two positions of the charts. He also became the first artist to
        have two songs debut in the US top 10 in the same week. By March 2017, Sheeran had accumulated ten top 10
        singles from ÷ on the UK Singles Chart, breaking the record for most top 10 UK singles from one album. His
        fourth single from ÷, "Perfect", reached number one in the US, Australia and the UK, where it became the
        Christmas number one in 2017. The world's best-selling artist of 2017, he was named the Global Recording Artist
        of the Year. Released in 2019, his fourth studio album No.6 Collaborations Project debuted at number one in most
        major markets, and spawned three UK number one singles, "I Don't Care", "Beautiful People" and "Take Me Back to
        London".
