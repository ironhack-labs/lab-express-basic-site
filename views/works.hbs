                    <h2>Netscape and JavaScript</h2>
                    <p>He started work at Netscape Communications Corporation in April 1995. Eich
                        originally joined intending to put Scheme "in the browser", but his Netscape superiors insisted
                        that the languageâ€™s syntax resemble that of Java. The result was a language that had much of the
                        functionality of Scheme, the object orientation of Self, and the syntax of Java. The first
                        version was completed in ten days in order to accommodate the Navigator 2.0 Beta release
                        schedule, and was called Mocha, but renamed LiveScript in September 1995 and later JavaScript in
                        December. Eich continued to oversee the development of SpiderMonkey, the specific implementation
                        of JavaScript in Navigator.</p>

                    <h2>Mozilla</h2>
                    <p>In early 1998, Eich co-founded the Mozilla project with Jamie Zawinski and others,
                        creating the mozilla.org website, which was meant to manage open-source contributions to the
                        Netscape source code. He served as Mozilla's chief architect. AOL bought Netscape in 1999.
                        After AOL shut down the Netscape browser unit in July 2003, Eich helped spin out the Mozilla
                        Foundation.

                        In August 2005, after serving as lead technologist and as a member of the board of directors of
                        the Mozilla Foundation, Eich became chief technical officer of the newly founded Mozilla
                        Corporation, meant to be the Mozilla Foundation's for-profit arm. Eich continued to "own"
                        the Mozilla SpiderMonkey module, its JavaScript engine, until he passed on the ownership of it
                        in 2011.

                        On March 24, 2014, Eich was promoted to CEO of Mozilla Corporation. Gary Kovacs, John Lilly,
                        and Ellen Siminoff resigned from the Mozilla board prior to the appointment, some
                        anonymously expressing disagreements with Eich's strategy and their desire for a CEO with
                        experience in the mobile industry.</p>

                    <h2>Brave Software</h2>
                    <p>Eich is the CEO of Brave Software, an Internet browser platform company that raised $2.5 million
                        in early funding from angel investors. On January 20, 2016, the company released developer
                        versions of its open-source Brave web browser, which blocks ads and trackers, and includes a
                        micropayments system to offer users a choice between viewing selected ads or paying websites not
                        to display them.

                        At Brave Software, Eich co-created the Basic Attention Token (BAT), a cryptocurrency designed
                        for use in the Brave browser. BAT launched its ICO on May 31, 2017 and raised $35 million.
