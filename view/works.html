      Gates wrote his first software program at the age of 13. In high school he
      helped form a group of programmers who computerized their school’s payroll
      system and founded Traf-O-Data, a company that sold traffic-counting
      systems to local governments. In 1975 Gates, then a sophomore at Harvard
      University, joined his hometown friend Paul G. Allen to develop software
      for the first microcomputers. They began by adapting BASIC, a popular
      programming language used on large computers, for use on microcomputers.
      With the success of this project, Gates left Harvard during his junior
      year and, with Allen, formed Microsoft. Gates’s sway over the infant
      microcomputer industry greatly increased when Microsoft licensed an
      operating system called MS-DOS to International Business Machines
      Corporation—then the world’s biggest computer supplier and industry
      pacesetter—for use on its first microcomputer, the IBM PC (personal
      computer). After the machine’s release in 1981, IBM quickly set the
      technical standard for the PC industry, and MS-DOS likewise pushed out
      competing operating systems. While Microsoft’s independence strained
      relations with IBM, Gates deftly manipulated the larger company so that it
      became permanently dependent on him for crucial software. Makers of
      IBM-compatible PCs, or clones, also turned to Microsoft for their basic
      software. By the start of the 1990s he had become the PC industry’s
      ultimate kingmaker. Largely on the strength of Microsoft’s success, Gates
      amassed a huge paper fortune as the company’s largest individual
      shareholder. He became a paper billionaire in 1986, and within a decade
      his net worth had reached into the tens of billions of dollars—making him
      by some estimates the world’s richest private individual. With few
      interests beyond software and the potential of information technology,
      Gates at first preferred to stay out of the public eye, handling civic and
      philanthropic affairs indirectly through one of his foundations.
      Nevertheless, as Microsoft’s power and reputation grew, and especially as
      it attracted the attention of the U.S. Justice Department’s antitrust
      division, Gates, with some reluctance, became a more public figure. Rivals
      (particularly in competing companies in Silicon Valley) portrayed him as
      driven, duplicitous, and determined to profit from virtually every
      electronic transaction in the world. His supporters, on the other hand,
      celebrated his uncanny business acumen, his flexibility, and his boundless
      appetite for finding new ways to make computers and electronics more
      useful through software. All of these qualities were evident in Gates’s
      nimble response to the sudden public interest in the Internet. Beginning
      in 1995 and 1996, Gates feverishly refocused Microsoft on the development
      of consumer and enterprise software solutions for the Internet, developed
      the Windows CE operating system platform for networking noncomputer
      devices such as home televisions and personal digital assistants, created
      the Microsoft Network to compete with America Online and other Internet
      providers, and, through Gates’s company Corbis, acquired the huge Bettmann
      photo archives and other collections for use in electronic distribution.
