He says his first videos were screencasting where he would post an image and just talk over it, then responded to requests from viewers of what they would like to watch. His first several hundred videos were primarily hardware tutorials and freeware.
                He was later approached by companies to demonstrate their paid software and hardware, but only reviews products that would be of interest to his audience of technology enthusiasts.</p>
