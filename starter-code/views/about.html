      The Lupin III manga, which first appeared in Weekly Manga Action on August 10, 1967, spawned a media franchise that includes
      numerous manga, two versions of an animated pilot film, five animated television series, eight theatrically-released
      animated films, two live-action films, five OVA works, twenty-five animated television specials, two musicals, many
      music CDs, and several video games. Many different companies have owned the English-language distribution rights to
      various Lupin III properties at various times, with just the first two animated films having been released by over
      10 companies alone. Tokyopop acquired the license to the original manga in 2002, and later the second series in 2004.
      Funimation Entertainment purchased the rights to several of the television specials and films in 2002, and the fourth
      television series in 2012. Geneon licensed and dubbed 79 episodes of the second television series, 26 of which were
      broadcast on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim during 2003. Discotek Media licensed the entire first, second and fifth television
      series and the first live-action film; they also own the rights to several other Lupin titles, including some previously
      released by other companies.
