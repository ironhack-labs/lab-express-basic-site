    <p>I feel like I have been cooking all my life. 
        Growing up, my sisters Anna and Linda and I spent summers in Sm√∂gen,
         on the west coast of Sweden. Every morning I went fishing with my dad, 
         Lennart, and my uncles. We caught crayfish, lobsters, and mackerel, and often 
         smoked and preserved the catch. My grandmother, Helga, would gather us in the 
         kitchen to teach us how to pickle fresh vegetables, and make meatballs, ginger snaps, cookies, 
        and apple jam. These experiences taught me to love and appreciate fresh and local food.</p>
