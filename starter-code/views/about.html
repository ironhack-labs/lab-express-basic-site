      <p>
        Michael Schumacher (/ˈʃuːˌmɑːkər/; German: [ˈmɪçaːʔeːl ˈʃuːmaxɐ] (About this soundlisten);
        born 3 January 1969) is a retired German racing driver who raced in Formula One for Jordan
        Grand Prix, Benetton and Ferrari, where he spent most of his career, as well as for Mercedes
        upon his return to the sport. Widely regarded as one of the greatest Formula One drivers
        ever,[1][2][3][4] and regarded by some as the greatest of all time,[5][6] Schumacher is the
        only driver in history to win seven Formula One World Championships, five of which he won
        consecutively. The most successful driver in the history of the sport, Schumacher holds the
        records for the most World Championship titles (7), the most Grand Prix wins (91), the most
        fastest laps (77) and the most races won in a single season (13), and according to the
        official Formula One website (Formula1.com), Schumacher was "statistically the greatest
        driver the sport has ever seen" at the time of his retirement from the sport.[7]
