    <p class="plot"><em>Tom and Jerry</em> is an American animated series of short films created in 1940 by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. It centers on a rivalry between its two title characters, Tom, a cat, and Jerry, a mouse, and many recurring characters, based around slapstick comedy.</p>
    <h2 class="plot-title">Plot</h2>
    <p class="plot">The series features comic fights between an iconic set of adversaries, 
        a house cat (Tom) and a mouse (Jerry). The plots of each short usually 
        center on Tom's numerous attempts to capture Jerry and the mayhem and 
        destruction that follows. Tom rarely succeeds in catching Jerry, 
        mainly because of Jerry's cleverness, cunning abilities, and luck. 
        However, there are also several instances within the cartoons where they 
        display genuine friendship and concern for each other's well-being. 
        At other times, the pair set aside their rivalry in order to pursue a common goal, 
        such as when a baby escaped the watch of a negligent babysitter, 
        causing Tom and Jerry to pursue the baby and keep it away from danger.
        The cartoons are known for some of the most violent cartoon gags ever devised 
        in theatrical animation such as Tom using everything from axes, hammers, firearms,
         firecrackers, explosives, traps and poison to kill Jerry. On the other hand,
          Jerry's methods of retaliation are far more violent due to their frequent 
          success, including slicing Tom in half, decapitating him, shutting his head or 
          fingers in a window or a door, stuffing Tom's tail in a waffle iron or a mangle, 
          kicking him into a refrigerator, getting him electrocuted, pounding him with a 
          ,mace, club or mallet, letting a tree or electric pole drive him into the ground, 
          ticking matches into his feet and lighting them, tying him to a firework and 
          setting it off, and so on.[2] Because of this, 
          Tom and Jerry has often been criticized as excessively violent. 
          Despite the frequent violence, there is no blood or gore in any scene.
           Music plays a very important part in the shorts, emphasizing the action, 
           filling in for traditional sound effects, and lending emotion to the scenes. 
           Musical director Scott Bradley created complex scores that combined elements 
           of jazz, classical, and pop music; Bradley often reprised contemporary pop songs, 
           as well as songs from MGM films, including 
           The Wizard of Oz and Meet Me in St. Louis, which both starred Judy Garland in a
            leading role.Generally, there is little dialogue as Tom and Jerry almost never 
            speak; however, minor characters are not similarly limited, and the two lead 
            characters are able to speak English on rare occasions and are thus not mute. 
            For example, the character Mammy Two Shoes has lines in nearly every cartoon in 
            which she appears. Most of the vocal effects used for Tom and Jerry are their 
            high-pitched laughs and gasping screams</p>
