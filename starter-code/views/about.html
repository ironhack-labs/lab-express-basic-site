    <h1>About Rihanna</h1>
    <div class = "about-p">
         <p>Robyn Rihanna Fenty was born on 20 February 1988,[11] in Saint Michael, Barbados. Her mother, Monica 
            (Braithwaite), is a retired accountant of Afro-Guyanese background, and her father, Ronald Fenty, is a 
            warehouse supervisor of Afro-Barbadian and Irish descent.[12][13] Rihanna has two brothers, Rorrey and 
            Rajad Fenty, and two half-sisters and a half-brother from her father's side, each born to different mothers 
            from his previous relationships.[14][15] She grew up in a three-bedroom bungalow in Bridgetown and sold 
            clothes with her father in a stall on the street. Rihanna's childhood was deeply affected by her father's 
            addiction to crack cocaine and alcohol, which contributed to her parents' strained marriage. As a child, 
            she went through a lot of CT scans for the excruciating headaches she suffered: "[The doctors] even 
            thought it was a tumor, because it was that intense."[14] By the time she was fourteen, Rihanna's parents 
            had divorced and her health began to improve.[13][16] Rihanna grew up listening to reggae music and began 
            singing at around the age of seven.[14][17] She attended Charles F. Broome Memorial Primary School and 
            Combermere High School, where she studied alongside future England cricketer Chris Jordan and future West 
            Indies cricketer Carlos Brathwaite.[18][14]</p>
        <p>Rihanna was an army cadet in a sub-military programme; the 
            singer-songwriter Shontelle was her drill sergeant.[19] Although she initially wanted to graduate from 
            high school, she chose to pursue a musical career instead.[20]Rihanna has named Madonna as her idol and biggest 
            influence. She said that she wanted to be the "black Madonna" and praised the singer for being able to 
            constantly reinvent herself successfully throughout her career.[206][207] "I think that Madonna was a great 
            inspiration for me, especially on my earlier work. If I had to examine her evolution through time, I think she 
            reinvented her clothing style and music with success every single time. And at the same time remained a real 
            force in entertainment in the whole world."[206] Another major influence on Rihanna's music and career has been 
            Mariah Carey, whose song "Hero" she performed when Rihanna was still a teenager at her high school talent show.[208] 
            She revealed that Carey's song "Vision of Love" "was the song that made [her] want to do music."[209][210]</p>
        <p>Recognized as a pop icon of today's music, Rihanna is one of the best-selling music 
            artists of all time, with 250 million records sold worldwide.[4] Rihanna is the 
            youngest solo artist to earn fourteen number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100, 
            and has a total of thirty one top-ten singles. She was named the Digital Songs Artist 
            of the 2000s decade, the top Hot 100 artist of the 2010s decade, as well as the all-time 
            top Pop Songs artist by Billboard.[5][6][7][8] Additionally, she is Spotify's most streamed 
            female artist of all time.[9] Among numerous awards and accolades, Rihanna has won nine Grammy 
            Awards, twelve American Music Awards and twelve Billboard Music Awards. Furthermore, she was awarded 
            with the inaugural American Music Award for Icon in 2013 and the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award 
            in 2016. Rihanna received the Fashion Icon lifetime achievement award from the Council of Fashion 
            Designers of America in 2014. In 2012, Forbes ranked her the fourth most powerful celebrity, while 
            Time included her on the annual list of the most influential people in the world.[10]</p>
