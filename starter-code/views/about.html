    <h2>James St. Patrick</h2>
    <div class="ghost-info">
    <div class="left">
        <p>In their younger days, Ghost and Tommy sold on the corner of their South Jamaica Queens hometown 
        for Kanan and Breeze. Long before Ghost met his wife Tasha, he and Tommy met Ghost's high school 
        sweetheart turned U.S. Attorney, Angie. Angie's family distrusted a young, troublesome Jamie who grew 
        to be both a role model for their old community and a dangerous player who desperately wants to transcend 
        society without paying for his crimes. After Angie moved away to pursue higher education choosing to please 
        her family over herself, Ghost lost the love of his life. This came at a time after which Ghost continued 
        to work for Breeze and Kanan. A dangerously intelligent Ghost convinced his wife Tasha to assist him with a 
        plan he devised to overthrow Breeze and Kanan and then eventually get out of the game. Ghost kills Breeze and 
        manages to put Kanan in jail. Being known to always have his head in a book, after a seemingly flawless success 
        of his plan, Ghost began to develop his alternate identity, James St. Patrick.Having three children with his wife Tasha, Ghost built wealth to prevent his family from the lifestyle he appeared to have escaped. He used money 
        earned from the great success of being a professional drug dealer to fulfill a dream of opening a nightclub (Truth) 
        along with his longtime friend Tommy. </p>

    <div class="right">
        <p>Tommy, not sharing Ghost's ambitions of eventually leaving the drug business, 
        agrees to open the nightclub only as a means of legitimizing and laundering more cash quicker. Both saving him from a 
        street gang and damning him by association, Ghost catches Julio in the tangled web between his desire to leave the drug 
        business and his proficiency at it that others had come to depend upon. Julio became third to Ghost only second to Tommy 
        before his world exploded. As if a divine act of encouragement for James' struggle to be a good man, he is reacquainted and 
        then reunited with Angie when she visits his club. This catalyst of Ghost's reignited love sends him into multiple monumental 
        and polar battles with self that have catastrophic effects on all those he loves. In an effort to change his ways way too late in 
        his life, Ghost sets off a chain reaction of impulsive indulgences that are equally worth it as they are torturing. Finally, a selfish 
        Ghost is satisfied with pursuing a relationship with Angie despite having had a family. As Angie carries out her career attempting to 
        prosecute criminals of Ghost's caliber, their paths inevitably cross bringing about an attempt at James St. Patrick's reckoning for the 
        many crimes of Ghost and with it many great losses.</p>
