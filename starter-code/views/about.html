            <h2>Rick Sanchez</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Sanchez is a misanthropic alcoholic scientist inspired by Emmett "Doc" Brown from Back to the Future. Known for his reckless, nihilistic behavior and pessimistic personality, the character has been well received. He is a sociopathic mad scientist who seems to know everything in the universe and thus finds life a traumatizing and pointless experience. <br> However, despite assuming to be the smartest person in the universe, there have been times where he has been wrong.
            He is formally referred to as Rick Sanchez C-137 by the Trans-Dimensional Council of Ricks, in reference to his original universe, "C-137". </p>
