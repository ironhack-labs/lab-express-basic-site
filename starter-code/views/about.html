    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, which are the seeds of berries from the Coffea plant.</p>
    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <p>The origin and history of coffee date back to the 10th century, and possibly earlier with a number of reports and legends surrounding its first use. The native origin of coffee is thought to have been Ethiopia. The earliest substantiated evidence of either coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree is from the 15th century, in the Sufi monasteries of Yemen. By the 16th century, it had reached the rest of the Middle East, South India, Persia, Turkey, Horn of Africa, and northern Africa. Coffee then spread to the Balkans, Italy and to the rest of Europe, to South East Asia and then to America.</p>
