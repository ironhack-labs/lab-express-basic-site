                  <p>Alice grew up in San Diego, California. His mother got an Apple IIc when she was six years old, one of his first experiences with technology. 
                    <br> Alice attended community college in San Diego and later transferred into UC San Diego where she studied mathematics. She went on to attend grad school for Mathematics at the University of Rochester where she studied algebraic topology, which she once found "very abstract and beautiful" for a couple of years but later got bored of it because "it was not so applicable to real life."
                    <br>  Once she realized that she did not want to be a mathematician for the rest of her life, she dropped out of the PhD program and bought a one-way ticket to South America and lived there for a year, where she found a job as a web developer. 
                    <br> She worked on a Ruby on Rails website for a snowboard company.</p>
