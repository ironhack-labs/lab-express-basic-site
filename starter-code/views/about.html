            <p>Pulling the harsh sounds of industrial rock into the mainstream, Trent Reznor and his band Nine Inch Nails became the face of industrial music in the '90s with hits "Head Like a Hole," "Closer," and "Hurt" gaining radio and television airplay as the band rose to the top of the charts with influential releases The Downward Spiral (1994) and The Fragile (1999). Nominated for over a dozen Grammys, NIN won a pair of Best Metal Performance awards in 1992 and 1996 for two tracks -- "Wish" and "Happiness in Slavery" -- from their metallic EP Broken. Extending longevity into the 2000s, NIN evolved while maintaining chart success with 2005's With Teeth, 2007's Year Zero, and 2013's Hesitation Marks, even as the band's style shifted to incorporate more atmospheric electronic elements influenced by frontman Reznor's Oscar-winning film score composition. In 2016, after decades as the only official member of the band, he welcomed English producer Atticus Ross -- his longtime film scoring partner and bandmate in side project How to Destroy Angels -- as NIN's first official second member.</p>

            <p>Michael Trent Reznor was born May 17, 1965, in New Castle, Pennsylvania and raised in Mercer, a small town outside Pittsburgh. His parents divorced when he was six and he was raised by his maternal grandparents. As a child, Reznor had already developed a keen interest in music. He learned to play piano, tenor sax, and tuba, playing in his school's jazz and marching bands while also acting in high-school productions of Jesus Christ Superstar and The Music Man. Outside of the classical sphere, his biggest rock influence was Kiss, whose theatricality and live shows would later inform NIN's acclaimed stage production. While studying music and computer engineering at local Allegheny College, he was a fleeting member of new wave outfit Option 30, contributing vocals and keyboards before parting ways with the band when he dropped out of school to pursue music full-time. He packed up and moved to Cleveland, Ohio with his friend Chris Vrenna, who later became a founding member of the first incarnation of NIN.</p>
            
            <p>While in Cleveland, Reznor was drawn to new wave and the industrial sounds of Ministry and Skinny Puppy. He gigged around town for a few years, playing in cover band the Urge before joining the Innocent as their keyboardist. The latter band released a single full-length, 1985's Livin' in the Street (Red Label Records), before Reznor quit. He soon hooked up with synth pop group Exotic Birds, contributing keys, programming, and backing vocals, while also recruiting Vrenna on drums. Despite their brief run together, Reznor appeared with the band in the 1987 Michael J. Fox/Joan Jett film Light of Day as a fictional band dubbed The Problems. His final roles in the local keyboardist circuit were with pop outfit Slam Bamboo -- they issued a single "White Lies"/"Cry Like a Baby" in 1988 -- and new wavers Lucky Pierre, whose vocalist Kevin McMahon would later form Prick, one of the first signees to Reznor's future record label, Nothing Records.</p>
            
            <p>During these stints, Reznor continued to work on his own material while employed as an assistant engineer and handyman at Cleveland's Right Track studio. When the shop closed for the day, owner Bart Koster allowed Reznor to use the facilities for free. The seeds from these early recording sessions -- on which he played keyboards, drums, guitars, and samplers himself -- would grow into Nine Inch Nails' first demo, Purest Feeling. After making NIN's live debut as tour openers for Skinny Puppy, Reznor shopped the demo tape around the U.S., landing a deal with indie label TVT Records. Reznor quickly returned to the studio to polish existing Purest Feeling tracks and record some new songs. The result, 1989's Pretty Hate Machine, presented a dark, synth-soaked vision of industrial that was also hook-heavy and accessible. Combined with a lyrical focus on sex, self-loathing, betrayal, angst, and religion, these attributes would become hallmarks of Reznor's early-era material. Pretty Hate Machine only peaked at number 75 on the Billboard 200, but a burgeoning cult following helped maintain its chart presence and sales. Buoyed by radio and MTV airplay for singles "Down in It" and "Head Like a Hole," it became the first independent release to receive platinum certification to date.</p>
