        <h4>CAI GUO-QIANG</h4>
        <h5>GUNPOWDER ART</h5>
        <p>25 Oct 2019–19 Apr 2020</p>
        <p>Gallery 11</p>
        <p>Free Admission</p>
        <p>Chinese artist Cai Guo-Qiang (b. 1957) is best-known for his gunpowder explosion events staged in public
          spaces worldwide and, in particular, for his firework display for the opening ceremonies of the 2008 Olympic
          Games in Beijing. This exhibition focuses on the artist’s smaller-scale works, exploring the presence of
          Chinese culture in his art through the mediums of painting, drawing, and gunpowder on canvas, paper and silk.
          Learn about the significance behind the materials Cai Guo-Qiang chooses to work with, as well as the ways he
          adapts them to explore his own central themes of creation, destruction and chance.</p>
