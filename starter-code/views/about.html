    <h1>Location of the earth</h1>
    <p> Knowledge of the location of Earth has been shaped by 400 years of telescopic observations, and has expanded
        radically since the start of the 20th century. Initially, Earth was believed to be the center of the Universe,
        which consisted only of those planets visible with the naked eye.
        Further observational improvements led to the realization that the Sun is one of hundreds of billions of stars
        in the Milky Way, which is one of at least hundreds of billions of galaxies in the Universe.
