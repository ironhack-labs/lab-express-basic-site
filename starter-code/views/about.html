        <p> piss off my owner early in the mornings</p>
        <p> break stuff and try to look guilty,..not a chance</p>
        <p> steal food </p>
        <p> no matter how small the size of a box is, i will fit in</p>
        <p> play hide and seek and attack without remorse to the legs when unnoticed</p>
        <p> unroll the toilet paper when no one is home and unravel mayhem out the house</p>
        <p> look for attention at times when people are busy, I like to feel important</p>
        <p> Go crazy and run across the house as if the world was coming to an end</p>
