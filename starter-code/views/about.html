        <p>Fiona Apple McAfee-Maggart (born September 13, 1977) is an American singer-songwriter and pianist.
          Classically trained on piano as a child, Apple began composing her own songs when she was eight years old. Her
          debut album, Tidal, written when Apple was 17, was released in 1996 and received a Grammy Award for Best
          Female Rock Vocal Performance for the single "Criminal". She followed with When the Pawn... (1999), produced
          by Jon Brion, which was also critically and commercially successful and was certified platinum.</p>

        <p>For her third album, Extraordinary Machine (2005), Apple again collaborated with Brion, and began recording
          the album in 2002. However, Apple was reportedly unhappy with the production and opted not to release the
          record, leading fans to erroneously protest Epic Records, believing that the label was withholding its
          release. The album was eventually reproduced without Brion and released in October 2005. The album was
          certified gold, and nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album. In 2012, she released her fourth
          studio album, The Idler Wheel..., which received critical praise and was followed by a tour of the United
          States and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 2013.</p>

        <p>She has sold over 10 million albums worldwide and has received numerous awards and nominations, including a
          Grammy Award, 2 MTV Video Music Awards and a Billboard Music Award.</p>

          <h2 class="col-md-12 mb-4 mt-4">Personal Life<hr></h2>
        <p>Apple is a vegan. During an in-depth interview on Marc Maron's WTF podcast she revealed that she has
          battled obsessive–compulsive disorder throughout her adult life and had recently decided to quit
          drinking. She has also gone on record about struggling with depression, self-harm, post-traumatic
          stress and trust issues with men, particularly in the wake of her rape.</p>

          <p>The fallout from Apple's breakup with her first serious boyfriend, Tyson, was the basis for her first album,
          Tidal. According to a 1998 profile in Rolling Stone, the two of them managed to stay on good terms. In the
          late 1990s she was linked with illusionist and endurance artist David Blaine, followed by writer/director Paul
          Thomas Anderson during the 2000s and writer/TV creator Jonathan Ames in the mid to late 2000s. She
          has admitted she maintains friendships with all of her ex-boyfriends, noting "I really care about them. I care
          about their lives with their girlfriends. I feel like maybe an annoying mother or something."In a
          June 2012 interview, she revealed she had briefly married a French photographer "for complicated reasons" and
          had a passing liaison with a younger woman.</p>

          <p>On September 19, 2012, Apple was arrested at an internal Border Patrol checkpoint in Sierra Blanca, Texas,
          and charged with possession of hashish. Authorities detained Apple at the Hudspeth County Jail.</p>

          <p>Apple resides in Los Angeles. In November 2012, Apple wrote a letter to her fans – a scan of which was
          posted to her website and her Facebook page – postponing the South American leg of her tour due to the health
          of her dog, Janet. According to the letter, the dog has Addison's disease and has had a tumor "idling in her
          chest" for two years.</p>
