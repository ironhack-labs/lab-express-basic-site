   <p><b>To take a glimpse into the mind of the Virtuoso, witness the words below.</b></p>

    <p>I provide an exclusive service. You'll find I murder the competition</p>
    <p>You will be poetry.</p>
    <p>You will be beautiful</p>
    <p>I feel inspired</p>
    <p>Art is worth the pain</p>
    <p>Beauty is pain</p>
    <p>I will make you famous</p>
    <p>You WILL perform!</p>
    <p>This is my love!</p>
    <p>Each bullet is a song.</p>
    <p>Each bullet will be a song!</p>
    <p>Fabulous!</p>
    <p>Smiles, everyone. Smiles!</p>
    <p>Places, please!</p>
    <p>Wonderful.</p>
    <p>The composition needs something.</p>
    <p>Sublime!</p>
    <p>Transcendant!</p>
    <p>Divine!</p>
    <p>Darling!</p>
    <p>Precious!</p>
    <p>Symmetry is so boring.</p>
    <p>I've outdone myself this time!</p>
    <p>When they find you, they will cry!</p>
    <p>I will touch your heart.</p>
    <p>They're gonna live until they die!</p>
    <p>This is my calling.</p>
    <p>Places, everyone, places!</p>
    <p>Shall we dance?</p>
    <p>Sing for me!</p>
    <p>I rehearse this!</p>
    <p>There is no drama in a peaceful death!</p>
    <p>Dance for me!</p>
    <p>Right on cue!</p>
    <p>The show never ends!</p>
    <p>How lovely!</p>
    <p>I couldn't miss your performance!</p>
    <p>These were clearly designed by a caveman.</p>
    <p>Gold is my power color.</p>
    <p>I prefer my equipment to make a bang.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, silence is loud.</p>
    <p>Start the music, I will make them dance.</p>
    <p>I have a thirst for melodrama.</p>
    <p>The storm is in their hearts. I calm them.</p>
    <p>It is by my will alone I set my mind in motion!</p>
    <p>I do prefer my work to have a brisk tempo.</p>
    <p>I love to perform, but I hate crowds.</p>
    <p>I always execute with style.</p>
    <p>We all wear masks, mine are just better crafted.</p>
    <p>Art is such a fickle thing.</p>
    <p>The essence of a thing is found only in its absence.</p>
    <p>Our performance begins!</p>
    <p>The stage is set.</p>
    <p>This stage is beneath my talent, but I shall elevate it.</p>
    <p>I will bring them an opera of death.</p>
    <p>And now, the curtain rises.</p>
    <p>You lack imagination; I have elaborate plans for you.</p>
    <p>Only my actions will make you memorable.</p>
    <p>It hurts so good.</p>
    <p>Only perfection is acceptable.</p>
    <p>*Evil laugh*</p>
    <p>The work is what matters.</p>
    <p>Art requires a certain cruelty.</p>
    <p>The end is important in all things.</p>
    <p>My audience awaits.</p>
    <p>I must wait until the composition is perfect.</p>
    <p>They're puppets, I pull their strings, and then, they dance.</p>
    <p>My genius will be understood, eventually.</p>
    <p>Art must exist beyond reason.</p>
    <p>They call me mad; all artists are mad.</p>
    <p>I will not suffer this ugliness.</p>
    <p>I cannot be good; I must be perfection.</p>
    <p>Every element must be in place!</p>
    <p>I am misunderstood; beauty can't be evil.</p>
    <p>This performance needs more zazz.</p>
    <p>My talent justifies all actions.</p>
    <p>I'm at my best only during the performance.</p>
    <p>I am pure. My work is pure.</p>
    <p>My theater is the mind.</p>
    <p>Art should terrify.</p>
    <p>No poet's words could match my craft.</p>
    <p>Death should never be quick; it should be an opera.</p>
    <p>I shall choreograph this affair.</p>
    <p>What sweet sadness is killing.</p>
    <p>The world is cruel. It doesn't have to be ugly.</p>
    <p>Everyone wears a mask. I just chose to create my own.</p>
    <p>This art is a compulsion; I cannot resist it.</p>
    <p>Perfection isn't good enough.</p>
    <p>Behind every mask is another mask.</p>
    <p>There is nothing for me but this.</p>
    <p>I never hurt anyone; it is the performance that kills.</p>
    <p>Until they stop me, I will keep going.</p>
    <p>I am the singer without a voice; the dancer without legs.</p>
    <p>Only to the audience do I show my true face.</p>
    <p>Each bullet is a piece of my soul; each shot is a piece of me.</p>
    <p>I swear each performance is my last, but I lie everytime.</p>
    <p>I am a slave to this passion.</p>
    <p>My work asks questions; it never has answers.</p>
    <p>Which is the lie: the mask or my face?</p>
    <p>An icon doesn't have to explain himself.</p>
    <p>I wonder what they think when they see me?</p>
    <p>Yes, the gun is ironic.</p>
    <p>I like a violent composition;</p>
    <p>This would be easier if blood came in more color.</p>
    <p>Let's start the show.</p>
    <p>The ecstasy of opening night.</p>
    <p>Smiles and screams...I bring both.</p>
    <p>If I keep getting interrupted, how can I be expected to work.</p>
    <p>I was paid to put on a killer show.</p>
    <p>My clients expect the best.</p>
    <p>They will dance, they will sing, they will die!</p>
    <p>A costume, some makeup, a spray of blood.</p>
    <p>It's very simple; when I shoot, they dance.</p>
    <p>My critics are usually short-lived.</p>
    <p>If I get this outfit dirty, I'm going to be so annoyed.</p>
    <p>I serve a discerning clientele.</p>
    <p>Death is certain, but killing doesn't have to be ugly.</p>
    <p>I provide catharsis for my clients and my victims.</p>
    <p>I orchestrate death.</p>
    <p>I get nervous before every performance, but I need that feeling.</p>
    <p>The moment before the shot is painful.</p>
    <p>It is only when the gun fires that I am alive.</p>
    <p>Mmm. the ecstasy of killing.</p>
    <p>The trigger on a loaded weapon; it whispers for us to act.</p>
    <p>I can't live without the euphoria of performance.</p>
    <p>Happiness is a warm gun.</p>
    <p>I want to feel everything; the gun makes it so I do.</p>
    <p>I envy silence, because I must be loud.</p>
    <p>In carnage, I bloom, like a flower in the dawn.</p>
    <p>I have risen from the filth and muck. I am the lotus blossom. I am beauty.</p>
    <p>That delightful moment before the curtain comes up.</p>
    <p>Art shall blossom from your fear.</p>
    <p>Life has no meaning, but your death shall.</p>
    <p>I live for the applause; you will die for it.</p>
    <p>I knew you would find your mark eventually.</p>
    <p>You've awoken something deep inside me.</p>
    <p>Face the crowd, and bleed for them.</p>
    <p>The face of your killer is identical to mine.</p>
    <p>With my technique, killing blooms into artwork.</p>
    <p>You inspire me.</p>
    <p>You will learn what beauty truly is!</p>
    <p>Smile! Everyone is watching!</p>
    <p>Bliss comes only in the moment before I fire.</p>
    <p>There is art here waiting.</p>
    <p>I inspire action.</p>
    <p>This passion compels me.</p>
