        <p class="text">Green is the color between blue and yellow on the visible spectrum. It is evoked by light which has a dominant wavelength
            of roughly 495â€“570 nm. In subtractive color systems, used in painting and color printing, it is created by a
            combination of yellow and blue, or yellow and cyan; in the RGB color model, used on television and computer screens,
            it is one of the additive primary colors, along with red and blue, which are mixed in different combinations
            to create all other colors.By far the largest contributor to green in nature is chlorophyll, the chemical by
            which plants photosynthesize and convert sunlight into chemical energy</p>
