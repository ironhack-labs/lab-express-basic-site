    <h1> Charles Mingus's Biography</h1>
    
    <p>
            The art of double bass player Charlie Mingus (1922) was rooted in the same general rediscovery of blues and gospel music as hard bop, but Mingus stood out for his highbrow studies on group improvisation and jazz composition. <br> His music was schizophrenic in that it both harked back to the New Orleans roots of jazz and looked forward to progressive chamber jazz and "third stream" jazz. <br> His compositions ranged wildly in mood and dynamics, from puntillistic counterpoint to massive Wagner-ian explosions. <br> He rarely employed great soloists, preferring dedicated session-men to stars with a strong personality, another way of emphasizing the compositional versus the improvisational nature of his art. <br> Mingus was the first jazz musician since Ellington who could compete with classical composers. A proud intellectual, he publicly despised the decadent habits of many jazz stars and even the barbaric attitude of the jazz audience (compared with the audience of classical music). <br> A precursor of indie music, Mingus founded his own label (1952) to avoid the commercial pressure of the major labels.

    <p>Raised in Los Angeles, he was also a rare specimen in a jazz world that was increasingly centered around New York. <br> A child prodigy, he composed a challenging Half-Mast Inhibition (1941) when he was just 19 years old. <br> He cut his teeth with Louis Armstrong (1942) and Lionel Hampton (1947-48), but had little in common with the swing era. He first displayed his true persona in a trio formed in 1950 by xylophonist Kenneth "Red Norvo" Norville with guitarist Tal Farlow. <br> Moving to New York, he mixed with the bebop avantgarde, playing a famous date with Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Bud Powell and Max Roach, immortalized on Jazz at Nassey Hall (may 1953). <br> He also appered on records by Bud Powell (1953), Charlie Parker (1953) and Paul Bley (1953).</p>
    <p>He established himself as one of jazz music's main visionaries with Pithecanthropus Erectus (january 1956), <br> recorded by a quintet that featured Jackie McLean on alto sax, Mal Waldron on piano, a tenor saxophonist and a drummer. <br> The highlight of the album was the ten-minute four-movement tone poem Pithecanthropus Erectus (partially free-form), <br> that influenced the birth of free jazz, <br> but the album also contained a 15-minute Love Chant, a moody and cryptic suite that confirmed his narrative gift, and an eight-minute version of Gershwin's A Foggy Day turned into a mini-symphony of city noises (all simulated by the instruments).</p>
