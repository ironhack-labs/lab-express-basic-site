        <p class="text">Blue is one of the three primary color of pigments in painting and traditional color theory, as well as in the RGB
            color model. It lies between violet and green on the spectrum of visible light. The eye perceives blue when observing
            light with a dominant wavelength between approximately 450 and 495 nanometres. Most blues contain a slight mixture
            of other colors; azure contains some green, while ultramarine contains some violet. The clear daytime sky and
            the deep sea appear blue because of an optical effect known as Rayleigh scattering. An optical effect called
            Tyndall scattering explains blue eyes. Distant objects appear more blue because of another optical effect called
            atmospheric perspective.</p>
