            Berlin (/bɜːrˈlɪn/; German pronunciation: [bɛɐ̯ˈliːn]) is the capital and largest city of Germany by both
            area and population. Its 3,711,930 (2017)[1] inhabitants make it the second most populous city proper of
            the European Union after London.[4] The city is one of Germany's 16 federal states. It is surrounded by the
            state of Brandenburg and forms the center of the Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which is, with
            6,004,857 (2015)[5] inhabitants and area of 30,370 square km, Germany's third-largest metropolitan region
            after the Rhine-Ruhr and Rhine-Main regions.

            Berlin straddles the banks of the River Spree, which flows into the River Havel (a tributary of the River
            Elbe) in the western borough of Spandau. Among the city's main topographical features are the many lakes in
            the western and southeastern boroughs, formed by the Spree, Havel, and Dahme rivers, the largest of which
            is Lake Müggelsee. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal
            climate. About one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers, canals and
            lakes.[6] The city lies in the Central German dialect area, the Berlin dialect being a variant of the
            Lusatian-New Marchian dialects.

            First documented in the 13th century and situated at the crossing of two important historic trade
            routes,[7] Berlin became the capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg (1417–1701), the Kingdom of Prussia
            (1701–1918), the German Empire (1871–1918), the Weimar Republic (1919–1933), and the Third Reich
            (1933–1945).[8] Berlin in the 1920s was the third largest municipality in the world.[9] After World War II
            and its subsequent occupation by the victorious countries, the city was divided; West Berlin became a de
            facto West German exclave, surrounded by the Berlin Wall (1961–1989) and East German territory.[10] East
            Berlin was declared capital of East Germany, while Bonn became the West German capital. Following German
            reunification in 1990, Berlin once again became the capital of all of Germany.
