          <h1>A Pale Blue Dot</h1>
          <p>
            "Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it
            everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of,
            every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate
            of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions,
            ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every
            hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every
            king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and
            father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of
            morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme
            leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived
            there--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam. <br />
            <br />
            The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the
            rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that,
            in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a
            fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the
            inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely
            distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their
            misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how
            fervent their hatreds. <br />
            <br />
            Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we
            have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by
            this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great
            enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness,
            there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from
            ourselves. <br />
            <br />
            The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is
            nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species
            could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the
            moment the Earth is where we make our stand. <br /><br />
            It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building
            experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of
            human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it
            underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another,
            and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've
            ever known."
