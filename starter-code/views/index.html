        <h1>Electric Cars</h1>
        <p>
          An electric car is a plug-in electric automobile that is propelled by one or more electric motors, 
          using energy typically stored in rechargeable batteries.

          Since 2008, a renaissance in electric vehicle manufacturing occurred due to advances in batteries, 
          concerns about increasing oil prices, and the desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Several 
          national and local governments have established tax credits, subsidies, and other incentives to 
          promote the introduction and now adoption in the mass market of new electric vehicles depending on 
          battery size, their all-electric range and purchase price. The current maximum tax credit allowed 
          by the US Government is US$7,500 per car. Compared with cars with internal combustion engine vehicles, 
          electric cars are quieter and have no tailpipe emissions, and in most places, with a few exceptions, 
          lower emissions in general.

          Charging an electric car can be done at a variety of charging stations, these charging stations can be
          installed in both houses and public areas.[6] The two best selling electric vehicles, the Nissan Leaf 
          and the Tesla Model S, have EPA ranges reaching 151 miles (243 km) and 335 miles (539 km) respectively.          
        </p>
        <p>
          As of June 2017, there are over 2 million electric cars in use around the world.[9] The Nissan Leaf is 
          the best-selling highway-capable electric car ever, with over 300,000 units sold globally by January 2018. 
          Ranking second is the Tesla Model S with almost 213,000 units sold worldwide through December 2017.
