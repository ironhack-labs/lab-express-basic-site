      <p>I can accept failure, everyone fails at something. But I can't accept not trying.
          Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence wins championships.
          Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.
          I've failed over and over and over again in my life and that is why I succeed.
        <br> Obstacles don't have to stop you. If you run into a wall, don't turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it, or work around it.
        One day, you might look up and see me playing the game at 50. Don't laugh. Never say never, because limits, like fears, are often just an illusion.
        You have to expect things of yourself before you can do them.
        <br> Just play. Have fun. Enjoy the game.
        I can accept failure, but I can't accept not trying.
        I've always believed that if you put in the work, the results will come.
