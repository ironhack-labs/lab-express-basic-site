    <h2>Origin</h2>
      <p>
        The earliest known example of the Elmo Rise image was posted on November 1st, 2012 by CakeWrecks.com[1] user Jen. The writer describes the image as, "if it's wearing the stricken expression of someone who will give you all the candy you want if you please just don't hurt himâ€¦then you're probably looking in a mirror. So go have some fun-size Snickers and put your feet up, my friend, because you've earned it."

        On June 28th, 2013, Tumblr [4] user teruteru666 reblogged the image from CakeWrecks.com and added the comment "rise." Several years later, on October 5th, 2015, the post received more than 250,000 notes in five years.
        On October 1st, 2014, Imgur [2] user StopTouchingMyButt published a gif of the Elmo image, superimposing it in front of a video of rising flames. The post (shown below, left) received more than 8,100 views in four years.
        Several months later, on July 24th, 2015, YouTuber Bretty Clough published a video of the gif. As of May 2018, the video (shown below, right) received more than 13,000 views.
