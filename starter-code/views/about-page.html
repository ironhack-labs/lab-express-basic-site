    <h1>Welcome to the about page of the church of Goku</h1>

    <p>Dear friend, have you accepted Goku as your personal lord and savior? If not, then please listen to my Good News! The
        Church of Goku can help you increase your power level to Over 9,000 and follow in the sacred footsteps of lord Goku
        by training with King Kai, hallowed be thy name.</p>
    <p>That’s right, there is now a Dragon Ball religion. It is called Gokuism, also known as The Church of Goku.</p>
    <p>Gokuism is the belief that the principles of Dragon Ball provide a moral compass for one’s life, and that Goku is an
        ideal role model and moralistic person. By some definitions, it implies that Goku provides personal, global, and
        universal salvation, and that his death and resurrections were for our sake.</p>
