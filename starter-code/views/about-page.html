        John John Florence — who has provisionally qualified to represent the
        USA at the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympic Games — is one of only five surfers
        in men’s Championship Tour history to clinch his first two World Titles
        in back-to-back fashion. Mark Richards, Tom Carroll, Tom Curren and the
        late Andy Irons are the only other members of that elite club.
      </p>

        The mild-mannered prodigy from the North Shore of Oahu has been living
        in the public’s eye since the age of eight, when he first paddled out at
        Pipeline, his backyard break that just happens to be the most famous
        wave in the world. By 12 he’d mastered a wide variety of ocean
        conditions and his breadth of ocean knowledge was compounded by the
        nurturing of North Shore sages, giving Florence all the evolutionary
        tools needed to become the best surfer in the world.
      </p>

        With their help, he navigated the pitfalls of early fame with humility,
        style and sweetness, and delivered under the heavy weight of high
        expectations. He remains, at his core, a performer first and foremost,
        with an insatiable appetite for progression. The only weakness in his
        surfing is making the impossible look too easy. And while it took a few
        years for him to sync his style to the demands of the Championship Tour,
        today his love of the game is peaking. The process of pushing himself as
        a competitor, artist, and innovator is what drives him.
      </p>
      <p>
        His deep love of sailing is only enhancing his ocean knowledge, and his
        film projects are an ever-expanding creative side hustle. Yes, he’s
        hungry for more World Titles, but there’s also that other nagging hole
        in his record: The Billabong Pipe Masters crown. Twice before he’s had
        victory within his grasp with just seconds to go, and twice he’s lost
        it. In 2013 it was 11-time World Champion Kelly Slater who broke his
        heart. In 2017 Jeremy Flores did the trick. Fortunately, the second
        World Title Florence earned earlier that day cushioned the blow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since that back-to-back World Title though Florence’s vertical ascent to
        the top has been decelerated by a series of injuries. In mid-2019,
        having won two events and sitting top of the Jeep Leaderboard, Florence
        ruptured his cruciate ligament. He didn’t surf until the final event at
        Pipe where despite still not being fully fit, he did enough to make the
        Semifinals and secure his spot for the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympic Games.
