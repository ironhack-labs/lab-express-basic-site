        The Science Of The Night
        by Stanley Kunitz
      </h2>
  
      <p>
      I touch you in the night, whose gift was you,
      My careless sprawler,
      And I touch you cold, unstirring, star-bemused,
      That have become the land of your self-strangeness.
  
      What long seduction of the bone has led you
      Down the imploring roads I cannot take
      Into the arms of ghosts I never knew,
      Leaving my manhood on a rumpled field
      To guard you where you lie so deep
      In absent-mindedness,
      Caught in the calcium snows of sleep?
  
      And even should I track you to your birth
      Through all the cities of your mortal trial,
      As in my jealous thought I try to do,
      You would escape me--from the brink of earth
      Take off to where the lawless auroras run,
      You with your wild and metaphysic heart.
  
      My touch is on you, who are light-years gone.
  
      We are not souls but systems, and we move
      In clouds of our unknowing
      like great nebulae.
  
      Our very motives swirl and have their start
      With father lion and with mother crab.
  
      Dreamer, my own lost rib,
      Whose planetary dust is blowing
      Past archipelagoes of myth and light
      What far Magellans are you mistress of
      To whom you speed the pleasure of your art?
      As through a glass that magnifies my loss
      I see the lines of your spectrum shifting red,
      The universe expanding, thinning out,
      Our worlds flying, oh flying, fast apart.
  
  
      From hooded powers and from abstract flight
      I summon you, your person and your pride.
  
      Fall to me now from outer space,
      Still fastened desperately to my side;
      Through gulfs of streaming air
      Bring me the mornings of the milky ways
      Down to my threshold in your drowsy eyes;
      And by the virtue of your honeyed word
      Restore the liquid language of the moon,
      That in gold mines of secrecy you delve.
  
      Awake!
      My whirling hands stay at the noon,
      Each cell within my body holds a heart
      And all my hearts in unison strike twelve.
