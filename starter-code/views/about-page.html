    <p> In just a few weeks bambú has become the dog celebrity of IronHack 2018. There was a lot of competition with other dogs in IronHacks's history like Loki and Gretta, but last friday Greta ate my pizza, and this morning Loki tried to rape me, so.. I've decided to make Bambú the offitial dog of our cohort. *Until he tries to steal my pizza or tries to be more than 'just friends'.</p>

    <p> Bambú is a Husky, black and white like most of he's fellow huskies. He is cool and chill, and it's rapidly becoming the most famous dog in the coding scene.</p>

    <p>Here's a picture of how Bambú would probably look like at the end of the cohort.</p>
