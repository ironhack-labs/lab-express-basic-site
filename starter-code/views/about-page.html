"," Now I'm armed! "And" Ô melody! ". Since then, Dinho Kapp became famous, asked, his cell phone does not stop to touch and receive messages, even from other states of the country, won the bird of the friend and the bordão turned to music.</p>
    <p>Dinho says he did not expect to become viral on the internet, said he made the video without any pretense and sent it in a WhatsApp group, but does not know who shared the images until he became the hit of the moment.</p>
    <p>Always smiling, the face of the mason changes for a moment, revealing that he has two great dreams. "My biggest dream is to find my daughter," she says excitedly.</p>
    <p>For more than 18 years, the mason does not see the girl who was four when her mother, Ana Lucia, took her away to Juazeiro do Norte in Ceará after the end of the relationship.
      </p>
    <p>"I'm like this, my God! I'm famous all over the world, even in Lisbon I'm, and her mother still has not seen me passing on the televisions and internet ?! Do not you think not?! ... I wanted to find my daughter so much and give her a really good hug! It will be beautiful when I find it! ", Complete, moved.</p>
    <p>Even with all the mishaps and difficulties the mason remains exactly as it appears in the video that made him famous, serene, cheerful and of such pure simplicity that he becomes childish.</p>
    <p>"People say, you are always excited, transmit animation and joy to everyone, but on the other hand you suffer. I know she's sick. I get sad, but I do not like to suffer, nor to be sad, it will not solve. I have to show joy, JOY, because I'm living and I can fight for it, "he says.</p>
