She starred in The All-New Mickey Mouse Club at age 11, and began a highly successful career as a pop singer and performer with the release of the single "...Baby One More Time" in 1998. Spears achieved massive sales with albums like Oops!... I Did It Again and Britney, before experiencing a series of personal and professional setbacks. She rebounded with the chart-topping Femme Fatale in 2011 and continues to release new material.</p>
