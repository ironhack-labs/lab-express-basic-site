            Nikola Tesla was born an ethnic Serb in the village Smiljan, Lika
            county, in the Austrian Empire (present day Croatia), on 10 July
            [O.S. 28 June] 1856.[13][14] His father, Milutin Tesla
            (1819–1879),[15] was an Eastern Orthodox priest.[16][17][18][19]
            Tesla's mother, Đuka Tesla (née Mandić; 1822–1892), whose father was
            also an Orthodox priest,[20] had a talent for making home craft
            tools and mechanical appliances and the ability to memorize Serbian
            epic poems. Đuka had never received a formal education. Tesla
            credited his eidetic memory and creative abilities to his mother's
            genetics and influence.[21][22] Tesla's progenitors were from
            western Serbia, near Montenegro.[23]

            Tesla was the fourth of five children. He had three sisters, Milka,
            Angelina and Marica, and an older brother named Dane, who was killed
            in a horse riding accident when Tesla was aged five.[24] In 1861,
            Tesla attended primary school in Smiljan where he studied German,
            arithmetic, and religion.[25] In 1862, the Tesla family moved to the
            nearby Gospić, Lika where Tesla's father worked as parish priest.
            Nikola completed primary school, followed by middle school.[25] In
            1870, Tesla moved far north to Karlovac[26] to attend high school at
            the Higher Real Gymnasium. The classes were held in German, as it
            was a school within the Austro-Hungarian Military Frontier.[27]

            In 1882, Tivadar Puskás got Tesla another job in Paris with the
            Continental Edison Company.[39] Tesla began working in what was then
            a brand new industry, installing indoor incandescent lighting
            citywide in the form of an electric power utility. The company had
            several subdivisions and Tesla worked at the Société Electrique
            Edison, the division in the Ivry-sur-Seine suburb of Paris in charge
            of installing the lighting system. There he gained a great deal of
            practical experience in electrical engineering. Management took
            notice of his advanced knowledge in engineering and physics and soon
            had him designing and building improved versions of generating
            dynamos and motors.[40] They also sent him on to troubleshoot
            engineering problems at other Edison utilities being built around
            France and in Germany.
