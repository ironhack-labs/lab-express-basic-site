          <h1>About Alex Honnold</h1>
          <p>
            Honnold was born in Sacramento, California, the son of community
            college professors Dierdre Wolownick and Charles Forrest[citation
            needed] Honnold. His paternal roots are German and his maternal
            roots are Polish. He started climbing in a climbing gym at the age
            of 5 and was climbing "many times a week" by age 10. He participated
            in many national and international youth climbing championships as a
            teenager.
          </p>

            "I was never, like, a bad climber [as a kid], but I had never been a
            great climber, either," he says. "There were a lot of other climbers
            who were much, much stronger than me, who started as kids and were,
            like, instantly freakishly strong â€“ like they just have a natural
            gift. And that was never me. I just loved climbing, and I've been
            climbing all the time ever since, so I've naturally gotten better at
            it, but I've never been gifted."
