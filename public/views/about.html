      <h1>Arnold Schwarzenegger</h1>
      <p>
        Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger (/ˈʃvɑːrtsnɛɡər/;[1][a] German: [ˈaʁnɔlt
        ˈʃvaʁtsn̩ˌʔɛɡɐ]; born July 30, 1947) is an Austrian-American actor,
        businessman, retired professional bodybuilder[2] and former politician
        who served as the 38th Governor of California from 2003 to 2011. As of
        2020, he is the most recent Republican governor of California.
        Schwarzenegger began lifting weights at the age of 15, and went on to
        win the Mr. Universe title at age 20 before winning the Mr. Olympia
        contest seven times; he remains a prominent presence in bodybuilding and
        has written many books and articles on the sport. The Arnold Sports
        Festival, considered the second most important bodybuilding event after
        Mr. Olympia,[3] is named after him. He is widely regarded as one of the
        greatest bodybuilders of all time, as well as the sport's most
        charismatic and famous ambassador.[4] Schwarzenegger gained worldwide
        fame as a Hollywood action film icon. His breakthrough film was the
        sword-and-sorcery epic Conan the Barbarian (1982), a box-office hit that
        resulted in a sequel in 1984.[5] He appeared as the title character in
        James Cameron's critically and commercially successful science fiction
        film The Terminator (1984), and subsequently played similar characters
        in the sequel films Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), Terminator 3:
        Rise of the Machines (2003), Terminator Genisys (2015) and Terminator:
        Dark Fate (2019). He also starred in other successful action films such
        as Commando (1985), The Running Man (1987), Predator (1987), Total
        Recall (1990) and True Lies (1994), in addition to comedy films such as
        Twins (1988), Kindergarten Cop (1990), Junior (1994) and Jingle All the
        Way (1996). As a Republican candidate, Schwarzenegger was first elected
        on October 7, 2003, in a special recall election to replace
        then-Governor Gray Davis. He was sworn in on November 17, to serve the
        remainder of Davis' term. He was then re-elected in the 2006 California
        gubernatorial election, to serve a full term as governor.[6] In 2011, he
        completed his second term as Governor and returned to acting.
        Schwarzenegger was nicknamed the "Austrian Oak" in his bodybuilding
        days, "Arnie" or "Schwarzy" during his acting career, and "The
        Governator" (a portmanteau of "Governor" and "Terminator") during his
        political career. He married Maria Shriver, the niece of 35th U.S.
        President John F. Kennedy, in 1986. They separated in 2011 after he
        admitted to having fathered an illegitimate child with their housemaid
        in 1997,[7] and their divorce was finalized in 2017. The name of his
        production company is Oak Productions.[8]
