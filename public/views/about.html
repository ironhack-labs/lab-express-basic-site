        Spanish designer and architect, Enric Miralles was born in Barcelona in 1955. He trained at the School of

        1980-1981.

        The independent architectural language of Enric Miralles can be difficult to classify in terms of contemporary
        architecture. It is influenced by Spanish architects, such as Alejandro de la Sota, Jos√© Antonio Coderch and
        Josep Maria Jujol, and also from international greats such as Le Corbusier, Louis Kahn and Alvar Aalto and the
        Russian Constructivist movement of the early 20th century. The freely formed buildings utilising massive
        building materials and steel, develop from their relationship with the environment and connect themselves to it.
        The form is constructed using often unusual materials which are generally left with natural surfaces. Form and
        material interpret the place, traditions and history in a personal and poetic art, as his critics attest. From
        the starting point of the townscape or landscape he would design a building in its totality, down to the details
        of the furnishing and the exterior installations. Therefore, the execution of the details was just as important
        to the communication of meaning as the main form. Both were developed over a large number of designs and with
        numerous models as the main tool of the design process.
