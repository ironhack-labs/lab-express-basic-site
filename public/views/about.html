          <h3>Who Was Marilyn Monroe?</h3>
          <p class="article-p">Actress Marilyn Monroe overcame a difficult childhood to become one of the world's
            biggest and most enduring sex symbols. Her films grossed more than $200 million. She is known for her
            relationships with Arthur Miller, Joe DiMaggio and, possibly, President John F. Kennedy. Monroe died of a
            drug overdose on August 5, 1962, at only 36 years old.</p>

          <h3>Early Life and Education</h3>
          <p class="article-p">Monroe was born on June 1, 1926, in Los Angeles, California. Monroe was named Norma Jeane
            Mortenson at birth (later baptized as Norma Jeane Baker). Growing up, Monroe spent much of her time in
            foster care and in an orphanage.</p>

          <p class="article-p">In 1937, a family friend and her husband, Grace and Doc Goddard, took care of Monroe for
            a few years. The Goddards were paid $25 weekly by Monroe's mother to raise her.</p>

          <p class="article-p">The couple was deeply religious and followed fundamentalist doctrines; among other
            prohibited activities, Monroe was not allowed to go to the movies. But when Doc's job was transferred to the
            East Coast, the couple could not afford to bring Monroe with them.</p>

          <p class="article-p">At seven years old, Monroe returned to a life in foster homes, where she endured sexual
            assault on several occasions; she later said that she had been raped when she was 11 years old. She dropped
            out of high school by age 15.</p>
        </article>
        <p class="article-p">Monroe had a way out through marriage, and she wed her boyfriend and merchant marine Jimmy
          Dougherty in 1942, at the age of 16. </p>

        <p class="article-p">Monroe never knew her father. She once thought Clark Gable to be her father â€” a story
          repeated often enough for a version of it to gain some currency. However, there's no evidence that Gable ever
          met or knew Monroe's mother, Gladys, who developed psychiatric problems and was eventually placed in a mental
          institution.</p>

        <p class="article-p">As an adult, Monroe would maintain that one of her earliest memories was of her mother
          trying to smother her in her crib with a pillow. Monroe had a half-sister, to whom she was not close; they met
          only a half-dozen times.</p>
