        Portman began her acting career at age 12 by starring as the young
        protégée of a hitman in the action drama film Léon: The Professional
        (1994). While in high school, she made her Broadway theatre debut in a
        1998 production of The Diary of a Young Girl and gained international
        recognition for starring as Padmé Amidala in Star Wars: Episode I – The
        Phantom Menace (1999). From 1999 to 2003, Portman attended Harvard
        University for a bachelor's degree in psychology, while continuing to
        act in the Star Wars prequel trilogy (2002, 2005) and in The Public
        Theater's 2001 revival of Anton Chekhov's play The Seagull. In 2004,
        Portman was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress
        and won a Golden Globe Award for playing a mysterious stripper in the
        romantic drama Closer.

        nomination, and a biologist in the science fiction film Annihilation
